"Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!"
"Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back."
"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again."
"I live in Md and the Aloft is my Home away from home...we stayed 1 night 7-7-16 ...Staff is great ! Especially Olivia who was Extra special because she remembered me by my voice over the phone ...which tells me she is very alert and pays attention to the customer their needs.AND SHE DID !

"I stayed here with my family for my daughters wedding. It had a very accommodating staff, Olivia was excellent. The rooms were very well maintained. Would highly recommend this hotel, especially if your wedding venue is Celebrations at the Bay!"
"Beautiful rooms and the nicest people working there. The front desk lady, Olivia, was extremely patient and helpful. We had lots of questions and she had just as many answers. The rooms were sleek and modern. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be free breakfast, but I really am asking for a lot. A++ stay. Thank... More"
"We stayed here while visiting Maryland Live!. Cute hotel in a great location. Clean, with a very modern look, upgraded bathrooms and amenities and super nice staff. Would definitely recommend and stay there again!"
"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More"
"In my line of work, I use meeting space in hotels often. In my 15+ years of doing this work, this is the first time I've felt the undeniable pull to go out and write a hotel review, based solely on my meeting room experience. Though I did not use a guest room here, my colleagues who did shared that... More"
"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More"
"Very friendly staff, great free breakfast items each morning, room and facilities very clean, staff superb! We had a problem with the heating system in our room and they had someone fix it within minutes! Would highly recommend this location/hotel."
"Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly. The room was clean including details, I'm talking no dust,no hair in bathroom-shower or beds which I tend to find in other hotels. Kudos to housekeeping. Sheets were crisp,beds were comfortable especially since this is a newer hotel. Breakfast in... More"
"This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return."
"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!"
"Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel."
"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.... More"
"Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!"
"I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure."
"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again."
"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!"
"After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me this... More"
"We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More"
"Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future"
"Even though we were having problems, i.e. Feather allergy, Flat tire, key not working...the front desk personell were always gracious and helpful."
"It was a great stay"
"Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location"
"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service."
"The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked.."
"I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars"
"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)...."
"Convenient and comfortable. Staff is great, breakfast and WiFi is a bonus."
"Awesome, Overall"
"Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference."
"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!"
"Repeat trip to this hotel for national conference attendance. Provides a quality stay, business center kept me in touch and great value for limited travel budget."
"I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!"
"Our room was a bit small. There was no microwave in the room. Location was more for couples than for family. The room itself And service were excellent."
"This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel."
"Hampton Inn never disappoints. Always an affordable, clean hotel with attentive and friendly staff. The breakfast is always a plus too. Also, the National Harbor is a nice area full of shops and dining choices and seems to be a family friendly hangout destination for locals."
"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great."
"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area."
"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent. Our conference managers were a gem, great service! Thank you for making an important event run so smoothly."
"We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable. The hotel offers great rooms, amenities and activities for all ages. I fell and fractured my hand on the last day of our stay (off property) and the... More"
"We arrived here very tired after 24 hours of travel and airports and from the moment we arrived we felt like royalty. We dined a Amaya multiple times (please see separate review). The room was stunning and more than we could ever expect, nothing was to little for the staff and they all seemed genuinely friendly even down to the... More"
"Stayed here for Thanksgiving and had the best experience. Before we arrived they asked my three year old little boy's name and when we arrived they had the most adorable kids travel pillow and personalized cookie waiting for him. They had children's games on the lawn right outside our bottom floor room, 105, and he had his face painted for... More"
"This exquisite property located in the penasquitos canyon of North County is a spectacular retreat. In a setting resembling a Mediterranean villa, the hotel is truly grand, with spacious rooms, several dining options and cozy sitting areas to relax and soak up the well appointed spaces and beautifully manicured grounds. The resort amenities include golf, tennis, heated pools and a... More"
"Five of the last six years, our company has hosted our annual meeting at the Grand Del Mar (and we regret not having it six out of six years). The GdM may be the top place to stay in the US, thus my recommendation is in the title of the review. The GdM is not inexpensive, but it is worth... More"
"This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready! The next day we had spa appts and the receptionist heard it was our honeymoon trip so after our massages we... More"
"The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places."
"Expensive Yes. Service Above the norm! Nickel and dime you on the small stuff Nope! (one of my pet peeves if you are going to stay at a hotel of this caliber) This property gives you 5 star service. Forgot your work out clothes Let the staff know your size. Need some feminine products, be there in 5 minutes. The... More"
"If you don't mind staying out of town, the Fairmont Grand Del Mar is a top quality choice for San Diego located about 25 minutes north of the airport. It is a large traditional colonial property, with a beautiful golf course on the west side of the grounds, ample parking, equestrian facilities and a good spa (which has the best... More"
"This property is absolutely pristine. The grounds are perfectly maintained, the rooms are luxurious with exquisite detail and the hotel in general is just a site to see. The location is great if you want to be away from the city and in a quiet area with gorgeous views of the hills (but close enough to to drive to Del... More"
"I love The Grand Del Mar in Del Mar California. This might have been my 6th time there. It is the only hotel in the area that i will stay at. It is truly a 5 star property. The staff is professional and very attentive. The rooms are very spacious, with marble bathrooms and separate shower and soaking tub. The... More"
"We had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont! This is an excellent hotel, with great attention to detail including hotel grounds, architecture, amenities and staff. Service is first class and natural, you are made to feel very welcome. Great looking golf course, and plenty of other activities to enjoy such as walking, the pool, tennis. Or just relax in the... More"
"To date, this takes the prize. It did not overwhelm me but I was, over the four days I stayed, consistently well served and impressed at the degree of detail that was maintained in every aspect of the experience. In the same way that the hotel service was a consistently delivered, high degree of service, without being over the top,... More"
"Give Robert a raise! We were trying to catch a flight from O'Hare to ATL early in the morning and my girlfriend forgot her phone in the room. Luckily, we called and he managed to get the phone as we made our way back on the provided shuttle bus. Orlando the shuttle driver was quick to pull us into our... More"
"We Had the best time ever! r r What a ball we had at Clarion Resort Waterpark! r r The place was large enough to have plenty of rides but small enough to walk comfortably. r r The entire facility is NEW and all the rooms are well"
"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need."
"Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel."
"Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable."
"Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made! And we were there for the historic parade to celebrate the Chicago Cubs World Series win and the icing on the cake was another historic win - Ireland beating the All Blacks after 111 years!"
"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!"
"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!"
"Good: The suite was very well apointed, plenty of room for an inroom breakfast --the bed and bedding were very nice. The staff couldnt be nicer We had a great night on the rooftop deck.... we never left the propertysmall plates a DJ and wonderful views. Ill be back"
"Bad: The view. Good: Everything"
"Beds were very comfortable, room amenities perfect. Enjoyed the lobby level coffee shop, roof top bar and happy hour on the 2nd level every evening. A great bonus!"
"Good: Beautiful rooms and amenities - L'occitane products. The restaurant Finch great food and amazing bar. Loved the Boxer"
"Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff."
"Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful."
"Good: The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the room,staff and location were all perfect- thank you The Boxer second time staying with you and all requirements were met."
"The location"
"Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!"
"Good: Very quaint hotel, good location, great staff...amazing time!"
"Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms."
"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston."
"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food."
"Good: A marvelous location, very friendly crew, it's clear hotel where you feel you are in Boston!"
"the bed was very comfortable"
"Good: Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff."
"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town."
"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return."
"Nice hotel with a great restaurant! Only thing that would have been nice to have it a bathtub rather than just a shower."
"Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby"
"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect."
"Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food"
"Good: Best gambling in Vegas and best comps! Brewery is great, rooms very clean, staff is wonderful. I only stay at Main Street."
"Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!"
"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees."
"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance."
"Bad: Very satisfied."
"Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb"
"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!"
"Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay"
"Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient."
"Bad: I loved everything. The parking, the restaurant ,the rooms and the the several acts that perform every night in the downtown area. Good: The people at the front desk were superb. They upgraded me to a real nice room."
"Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep."
"Bad: Better meal choices. Pool and fitness center on property. Good: Ease of conveniece to everything I needed"
"Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service"
"Bad: The bar tender in the Casino was not at all friendly or attentive. Good: very nice restored hotel. Excellent condition. Great atmosphere. A very nice place to stay in Downtown Las Vegas"
"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!"
"Bad: good. Good: yes"
"Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower."
"Bad: No self parking.. had to reach down to flush toilet. Good: Location"
"Bad: We liked everything. Good: The beds were comfortable the rooms were clean"
"Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most"
"Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view"
"Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable."
"Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!"
"Good: Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast, nice to have a lounge to sit and read the newspapers provided. Stored luggage until we were ready to leave. Would stay again."
"Bad: parking. Good: BREAKFAST AND THE BAR WERE REAL NICE........BARTENDER chris ..great guy"
"Good: Location is fabulous. Got there very early and was able to check in! Room was clean and modern. Love this hotel!"
"Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again."
"Bad: Highly recommend. Good: Modern style, great location, super helpful staff, continental breakfast included, great value, clean"
"Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff"
"Good: great location breakfast"
"I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet"
"Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet"
"Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it."
"Bad: breakfast is normal. Good: I am very satisfied this hotel."
"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future"
"Good: Bar had a good atmosphere, room was really cute."
"Bad: The pillows were flat. Good: It was a great location close to everything. The bathroom was newly remodeled and beautiful! The bed was average but I got good night's sleep."
"Good: Loved the sound system in the room and the fact that they have coffee all the time!"
"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location."
"Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!"
"Everything was perfect"
"Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation."
"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors."
"Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable."
"Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay."
"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel."
"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours."
"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind"
"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again."
"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu."
"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!"
"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed."
"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs."
"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu."
"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!"
"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!"
"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!"
"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT"
"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel."
"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area."
"I have stayed at the hotel several times over many years (while it was The Carlton). I am SO Very excited about this hotel for so many reasons. While I know there has been some challenges with renovations, I wish people would not get hung...More"
"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly."
"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!"
"Bad: The mini bars are basic. I mean... if that's the only thing I can think of ...then this place is amazing. Good: Everything was perfect. Friendly staff, wonderful location, and they even had a whole setup with lounges on the beach that I was unaware of that was just perfect, too."
"Good: From the room, to the staff to the location.....this hotel has it all... and who doesnt like breakfast that is served until noon....i was a little worried at first, because i couldnt believe the deal we got for a hotel in SoBe....but everything was just PERFECT...."
"Good: Courtesy, friendliness of employees. Perfect location."
"Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach."
"Good: Staff and service was very friendly and helpfull. Hotel is nice, location is nice."
"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows."
"Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!"
"Bad: the only thing i found not 100 great was the low water pressure in the shower. Good: i love everything about the hotel really. it's just 2 blocks off the beaten track in a very quiet, ye central area of south beach. came during art basel so prices were of course high, but still reasonable"
"Good: Room was lovely, shower was great, staff were friendly and very helpful. Bed was comfortable and the room was really quiet"
"Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!"
"Good: I really liked the water in the lobby."
"Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!"
"Good: Amazing hotel.good location.very clean.friendly staff."
"Bad: Rooms are a little compact, but that had little impact on our stay!. Good: Location was excellent and the price was very reasonable compared to other properties. Staff were all amazing."
"Good: can't wait to stay here again!"
"Good: It was a great location and had amazing decor."
"Bad: There was nothing I did not like. Good: Art Deco, location, price, and bed...."
"Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing"
"Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there."
"Good: Didnt smell like smoke, and no gambling"
"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip."
"Bad: The phone receiver didn't work. And the room wouldn't get as cold as I like. Good: I love my stay at the Westin."
"Good: I loved everything"
"Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas."
"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all"
"Bad: .. Good: Five minute walk to The Strip - Belligio. Monorail station across the street at Bally's. Car hire agency in hotel."
"Good: Right off strip with all extras included in room price"
"Good: It was located just off the strip and easy access to everything can't go wrong!!!"
"Good: The staff was incredibly accommodating! The pool was open 24 hours which was perfect for a late night dip after walking the strip! The view was gorgeous, and conveniently located near the strip."
"Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue. Good: Cleanliness of the hotel, the polite and helpful staff."
"Good: Convenient and clean"
"Bad: Away from the strip . Good: Its a relaxing hotel .."
"Bad: no free breakfast. Good: how clean and comforting it was"
"Good: Great value. Great location."
"Good: Great location just off The Strip down from The Flamingo easy walking distance to main attractions."
"Good: Only a block off the strip. Luxurious feeling room. Excellent value!"
"Good: Excellent breakfast"
"Bad: No bank ATM's...scandalous...not fair. Good: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE WESTIN. This one didn't disappoint either. Location was great, staff was great and facilities were excellent and clean! The view want bad either."
"Good: Top of the line..great"
"Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets."
"Bad: Gym was closed. Only notification on website was the spa closure. Good: Great + accommodating staff"
"Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds"
"Good: I loved the fact that staff was very understandable and after a very tough night (shooting and evacuation of the whole Strip) let us stay complimentary till 4pm. This was really exceptional service and hospitality. Thank you!"
"Bad: nothing to complain about. staff very helpful. Good: bed extra comfy"
"Good: We were very pleased with everything."
"Good: The comfort in the bedroom was excellent, good blankets, soft pillows, a bathroom really clean, the staff was really nice."
"Bad: The smell sometimes from sewer only when in hallway. Good: The hotel was great and staff was very friendly. We will definitely stay there again"
"Bad: The coffee at breakfast was too watery. Good: Beds were super comfortable!!"
"Bad: Overbooked, could not get additional night. Good: Nice accomodations."
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Extremely friendly staff. They help you in every difficulty. You can depend on them."
"Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!"
"Good: This hotel it's the most amazing I have ever stay everything of this hotel it's just awesome"
"Bad: no breakfast incl. Good: close to action but off the strip, so quiet"
"Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!"
"Bad: Room was a little tight. Good: Comfortable beds: adequate bathing supplies"
"Good: Customer service and overall quality of hotel was excellent"
"Good: Nice room, friendly staff"
"Good: Bed was awesome"
"Bad: No microwave in room. Good: Bed extremely comfortable professional staff, extra clean. Great place. Also liked the 24-hour Starbucks."
"Good: Great location, quiet rooms, wonderful staff. Was a real pleasure to stay there."
"Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast."
"Bad: Nice hotel in LV close to everything. Good: Everyyhing"
"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis. In fact our rooms are designed in and out to offer a little break from the city while you are in the city. We wish to have you back again very soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com."
"The Broome is a well-situated, warm and welcoming boutique hotel in the heart of Soho. The rooms are sizable and airy, the staff friendly and knowledgeable and the location superb. My daughter and I had a wonderful time and will definitely return.Dear Bethshorstein:Thank you again for choosing to stay with us at The Broome SoHo NYC and thank you for taking the time to share with us. We really appreciate your feedback and it was a joy having you and your daughter with us. We really hope to get to see you again soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com."
"Bad: The parking rates are outrageous (59 USD/day for valet), but this is for all of Boston, not just this hotel. . Good: Great location, very convenient for Boston Commons, subway and good restos. Hotel was very nicely appointed with great products. Wish we had time to use Bliss Spa!"
"Bad: The hotel cannot control the metal plate in the road that bangs when cars drive over it all night. Good: The bed was very comfortable and the berries and fresh fruit were awesome! The staff was friendly and more than made up for a mishap with the room reservation."
"The staff, location , room, enjoyed our stay ."
"Bad: Our room was missed one night to clean (we didn't care about the bed, but we needed some supplies). It's OK, not a big deal. Good: Great location to visit Boston. Room was spacious and modern. Overall staff was professional and friendly."
"Everything was excellent and the staff were warm and friendly"
"Bad: no. Good: very good"
"Bad: We only had one robe in our room and no slippers, but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk. Good: We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site, but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!"
"Good: Very nice room and quite big. Nice ambience and cool bar plus helpful staff."
"Bad: I wish breakfast was included in the price. Good: Everything!! Especially the fitness center."
"Bad: Everything was great. Good: The staff was very helpful and efficient."
"Good: I loved all the technology that the room had offered and also I loved the look of the room it was awesome , this hotel is a great stay for anyone! Im definitely coming back soon !"
"Bad: Nothing much. Good: Modern, Soft beds, Great atmosphere"
"The staff and amenities are excellent!!"
"Good: Very friendly staff. And perfect location in the theater district."
"Good: Everything"
"they were able to accommodate us with a feather free room. the door men were especially friendly and remembered us!"
"Good: Wonderful service, awesome riom service menu (especially the late night offerings). Awesome amenities."
"Big room"
"Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston."
"no very good"
"Bad: The price of the wifi. Good: Everything"
"Good: Great property! Excellent team of young dedicated profeccionals"
"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !"
"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager"
"Service was outstanding from the valet, bellman, front desk to the butler. Everyone is top notch. The location is great, a few blocks from Central Park and shopping. The rooms have great decor and the right size.Dear YoYoMass, Thank you for choosing The St. Regis hotel amongst the hundreds of hotels in New York City to enjoy your recent visit. We appreciate your kind comments on TripAdvisor and hope to welcome you again. Sincerely, Octavia Marginean Hotel Manager"
"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic. Thank you to the FPA for everythingDear PIERRE-YVES L, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager"
"Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced. The restaurant for breakfast was great and the bar at cocktail time was typical of a New York happy hour, loud and happy.Dear Richard K, We appreciate your review on TripAdvisor of our hotel and we are delighted that you have made The St. Regis Hotel your new home away from home. We will share with our team your praises and we are thankful for your visit. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Here for business meetings, had some glitches with services like wifi and AV but we're fixed immediately, even though they were our mistakes not the hotel's. Others have pointed out interior vs exterior rooms. Rooms are spacious with floor butler at your service. Awesome!Thank you very much for your recent review on TripAdvisor. We truly appreciate you taking the time to detail your experience, and we are so pleased that you had a wonderful visit at The St. Regis New York. We will share your comments about our business accommodations with our team members, and we grateful of your praises.We look forward to welcoming you back as our guest in the near future!"
"I love the location, the staff, the restaurants, THE BAR, the rooms and all of the extra services that are offered here where staff remember so many little details about previous trips that each return is like an extended day from the last stay."
"Amazing hotel, great service . They make you feel like you are their main concern . The rooms are amazing very clean, and equipped with every thing. It's my forth time here and I'm sure I will be back here again. The hotel experience is part of what makes the trip :)Dear adeeyacoby, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel again and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you back soon.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends"
"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray"
"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Stopped in for mimosas and coffee while shopping in 5th Avenue. Where else can you get a Veuve Cliquot Mimosa Beautiful, nostalgic, old world. They also have a Nat King Cole Bar with wonderful history.Dear Cheriejay, Thank you very much for your kind words. We are pleased that you enjoyed your mimosa at our iconic King Cole Bar, and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Kindly, Senih Geray General Manager"
"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience. We will definitely stay here upon our return to New York CityDear GK1708,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We are very pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and especially your experience in the Athletic Club. We will share your kind comments with Janelle and the team, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager"
"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"

"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager"
"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean"

"This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis. The food is extremely good in their restaurant and the King Cole bar is internationally famous.Dear 112traveler47, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We look forward to sharing your review with the team, and we hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Warmest Regards,The St. Regis Management Team"

"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel. Congrats and Thank you! Dear jfcollobert,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay and that our team provided you with excellent service.

We look forward to having an opportunity to welcome you back to our hotel again soon.Kindly,Senih GerayGeneral Manager"
"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

"Just an amazing place. You are treated like a king all the time. This place has ruined me for all other hotels. I am going again this weekend and cannot wait. Maria Christine Duhon and Liubov were amazing. They took care of everything and made sure my wife and I were happy. I highly recommend the St Regis.Dear da0987654321, Thank you for your recent review on TripAdvisor. We truly appreciate you taking the time to detail your experience, and we are so pleased that you had a wonderful visit at The St. Regis New York.

"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
"We enjoyed our lunch at the St. Regis. From the service to the food and drink, everything was impeccable. The setting is classic and polished, comfortable and beautiful. It was our first time at the St. Regis and we will return. Highly recommended.Dear mnkittycat, Thank you so much for having lunch at The St. Regis New York. We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"I have never been so impressed with the customer service of a hotel. Every single staff member went above-and-beyond to make us feel like we were the most important guests in the hotel. I have traveled all over the world, and have never been more impressed with the level of hospitality provided at the St. Regis in NYC.Dear Julie D, A complimentary review such as yours is always welcomed. Thank you for taking the time to post your comments on TripAdvisor. I sincerely look forward to welcoming you back to The St. Regis Hotel New York in the not-so-distant future.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We will share your kind words with our staff, and we are so grateful for your support!We look forward to welcoming you back to New York soon! Kindly, Maria Wittorp-DejongeChef Concierge"
"If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager"
"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms"
"Bad: Had a very frustrating time booking online. The website was not secure. Good: Clean. Very important!"
"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant."
"Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun.. Good: Bed was high -had to climb up- but very comfortable with great fluffy pillows and linens! Japanese toilet seats! Able to adjust room climate. Convenient to Japanese stores and museum. Great area restaurants. Nice caf shop on the ground floor."
"Bad: Happy hour prices to expensive. Good: Locatation"
"Good: Great location and nice facilities. Large clean rooms and the staff were very helpful. Would have no problem staying here again."
"Good: The AC hotel was perfect for what we needed. We were a group of friends coming from different states to meet up. It was conveniently located close to public transportation and made it easy for all of us to get there. The hotel was in a great location! It's close to Michigan Avenue/ Water Tower Mall and Navy Pier."
"Well situated near magic mile for shopping and walking distance from the loop. CTA station pretty close to hotel."
"Good: Fun location, very nice hotel. Especially liked the simple breakfast."
"Bad: Shower exposed to room. Good: The room was quiet and private."

"Bad: Shower. Good: Doorman was wonderful- very helpful."
"Good: The shower was amazing, I cannot speak highly enough about the shower. I travel regularly and this was the best hotel that I have ever stayed at."
"Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!"
"Good: Wonderful, friendly staff and incredible location. Loved the happy hour and breakfast on each floor. Couldn't have done better for a first trip to Chicago."

"Good: Everything was amazing I will for sure be back!"
"Good: The bar on the rooftop"
"Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location."
"Bad: The breakfast could have had more protein options. Good: Loved the room and the location"
"Good: Wonderful hotel with great location and customer service. The lounge was amazing every night for a drink and snacks. Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Breakfast every morning was way better then we expected. Contacting the front desk was easy via text for anything we needed or with questions. We have traveled to many other cities and Europe and this was one of our top stays."
"Good: Location"
"Good: Everyone was so nice. Thank you"
"Bad: everything was great besides the bar lounge on the top floor. It could use some renovations. Good: Bed was extremely comfortable!"

"Good: Loved our room, bed, breakfast buffet, fridge in room, free WiFi , location, happy hour, and outstanding suggestions and great help from Concierge, Ken. Highly recommend this hotel."
"Good: The convienance to everything. Just by walking out the front door of Kinzie Hotel."
"Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!"
"Good: No fuss, no hassle, delivers exactly what it says."
"Bad: I wanted to watch Netflix and couldn't, BUT THEY SAID NETFLIX WAS COMING!! By the end of August the hotel is getting new TV system to watch my shows! So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well."
"Bad: Absolutely nothing!. Good: Such a relaxing hotel in the hub of the city. Breakfast located on each floor next to the lift was great, bed was sooo comfy, bathroom fab and the view stunning. Cocktail hour with nibbles each night was such a nice touch. What makes the Kinzie thou are the staff!"
"Good: Best sleep I've had at a hotel"
"Good: the location was perfect, the hotel spa was very good with variety of service, the staff were extra friendly the room was clean. would defiantly come again."
"Bad: No parking. Good: Location Room looks Additional appetizer"
"Good: All the staff was genuinely friendly."
"Bad: I dont like the anchovies in the Caesar dressing. Good: Bed and pillows are the best"
"Good: Perfect hotel"
"Good: Great location. Staff was amazing"
"Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great."
"Good: Everything , I travel the world since I was I child and I never see a hotel like zetta hotel, it's amazing."
"Bad: Breakfast can be better. Good: Everthing is perfect!"
"Bad: Our AC was not working but they provided us with a portable fan, which helped. It was nice they provided water and snack bar was stocked with a variety of things. Good: Central to lots of sites and walking around is convenient"
"Good: The staff were professional, friendly and eager to please. It was our anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us on arrival which was a really lovely touch. The Cavalier bar/restaurant is super and make sure you have Liam mix up one of his fabulous cocktails! Very central location but nice and quite hotel."
"Bad: Nada. Good: Amenities, staff, decor, room"
"Good: Love the contemporary look with all of the art! Great location and friendly, helpful staff. It is walking distance to the San Francisco Museum of Art and to great shopping!"
"Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!"
"Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not."
"Good: The staff is above and beyond friendly, and it's not insincere. Just great personality. Upgraded our room for my gf's birthday, and a complimentary bottle of wine. Nice touch!"
"We had an absolutely delightful stay at the charming 1906 Lodge. It's hard to know where to begin describing all the positive aspects of staying there! Our room, The Plunge, was spacious and clean. Breakfast in the morning was a culinary treat. A cold buffet and hot entre were both available. We made use of the cruiser bikes and loved... More"
"Home 2 not only has an excellent location (walking distance to the Convention Center, Reading Terminal Market, China Town, Liberty Bell and South Street.) but is the BEST hotel I have stayed in with-in the city itself. Rooms are very large and clean. The beds are comfortable. I love this place!Not only is this place modern but it's super clean, quiet. Full kitchen including a dishwasher. There is a pod coffee maker with tons of pods to choose from. Excellent coffee bar in lobby and a large breakfast buffet is included.I would definitely stay here again!

"Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More"
"Great spot with kids and family. Would definitely stay here again. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Convenient to reading market. Nice to have breakfast included and hot coffee available all day. Kids loved the pool - although it was small."
"The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3.

"Very clean and comfortable rooms. Kitchenette included in the room. All staff was friendly and helpful. Great lobby and an excellent breakfast. Wonderful location, right across from the Philadelphia convention center and Reading Market. The Southeast Pennsylvania Regional Transit Association rail terminal and train to the airport is next to the Reading Terminal. Easy walk to Independence Mall. Lots of shopping and eating nearby."
"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites. We will definitely look forward to staying here again .Dear saturn445,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem. Plan to return with my family! Definite yes for anyone staying in Center City."
"This was my first stay at a Home2, and I was very pleased. The staff was excellent, the hotel clean and well-appointed, and breakfast was good and plentiful. The fitness center has sufficient equipment, but at least one machine did not work right and was not taken out of service/repaired during my week-long stay."
"Perfect location in the center of the city. Right across the strret from the market. And 5 min walk to take the Phlash bus loop around the city -RIDE ALL DAY 5 BUCKS PER PERSON. For craft beer lovers - 10 minute walk to Bru' on Chesnut Street with a HUGE tap line changes every day. Omar and Thomas at... More"

"I would highly recommend staying at this hotel. The rooms are spacious and highly accommodating. The hotel is clean. The food market located directly across the street is very interesting and they have anything you could possibly be craving. The coffee downstairs is free with to-go cups and it's actually delicious.Dear barbieann12,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again."
"Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left."
"Rooms are a bit small but you are in Chicago and don't spend much time in the room. Everything was very clean. Location was excellent. Close to restaurants and attractions. Pillows were wonderful. Fresh water and bottles available on each floor. Coffee and snacks in lounge morning and evening"
"Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!"
"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage."
"The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this."
"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls. Come see us again soon.RegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager"
"I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast."
"Good location, it's close to museums that I love. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing, moderate size. There's cold water to refill your water bottle. The price is affordable. I felt as if it was a safe area and I had no worries or concerns about the location. I enjoyed the next door restaurant. It's an easy breakfast location.Since I was staying by myself, I would have enjoyed a movie channel to buy from but I never found it.Good coffee for the morning.Dear MarjieThank you for your review and I am so glad that we succeeded in looking after you on many area's. I have passed on your comments to our housekeeping department as we all know that providing a clean room is essential and it is something we all take great pride in.When you are next in Chicago, we would be delighted to look after you again.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager"
"My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago."
"I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space. We work hard to ensure all our guests' stay is as pleasurable as yours was.We look forward to being of service to you once again when you return to Las Vegas!Safe Travels,"
"Close to the river with shops and restaurants. Uber/taxi over and enjoy yourself for the night. They used to have a great full breakfast included but now it costs 16-bummer. Staff is helpful and polite. You are 10 minutes to downtown Napa."
"Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review. We are really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope you come visit us again."
"Spotless room, comfortable bed, free wi fi, caring and efficient staff. Well located, near the downtown area, close to main highways and wineries. Plenty of parking, elevator to 2nd and third floors, Coffee and tea in room, Denny's restaurant next door.Stan, We are glad you had a great stay. Clean rooms, comfortable bed and great service is what we strive for. Come back and see as again."
"My family and I had a wonderful stay! great service and hospitality. We are looking forward to staying again!Thank you for choosing to stay with us and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit to Napa."
"This is the quietest, nice friendly hotel I've been in for years. Service is second to none. Clean, clean, clean. Perfect location for access to all Napa wineries. Lots of room, not cramped in as usual in hotels. Staff was so friendly and helpful, gladly helped with any questions. Will go back for sure, price is decent considering the area.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay. We are here to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We will see you the next time your in the area."
"The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review. Our location is very conveniently located close to shopping, restaurants and the downtown area. We are thrilled your stay with us was so satisfying and look forward to seeing you again."
"The room was very clean, large room and had a nice decor. It was centrally located to various wineries, outlett, restaurants and downtown area. Based on our overall experience, we will definitely return to this hotel.It was a pleasure having you as our guest for your anniversary. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and will see you on your next visit."
"Our stay was perfect. The room was immaculate and location was great.The people at the front desk were so accommodating and helpful.We arrived early and they got us a room before check in time.They gave helpful restaurant choices as well!!Hey Dianne! We are happy you enjoyed your stay! Please come back and see us again! Cheers!"
"We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley. Shirley A - Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review. We do our best to make sure everyone's stay is as pleasant as yours was. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you - Genafer, Director of Sales"
"I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!"
"Inn at the Vines is always a great stay in Napa Vallley. Good rooms and nice, friendly employees make this a wonderful stay. Great price/value! We dont use the free breakfast at Dennys but still nice that is included. Good location for visiting wine country."
"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!"
"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again."
"My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel! Genafer and the other woman in the office were both very friendly and I plan on staying there again when I go back in October!Rhonda S - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and we look forward to you and your husbands visit in October. Make sure to ask for me when you arrive and I will make sure to have more suggestions for you."
"Charged me for the night that didn't stay. I booked through Booking.com and kept telling me to contact Booking.com and they didn't take any responsibility. There are no confirmation emails or calls for my booking. 0 customer service.Myat Thu L - After reviewing your reservations. I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through. Unfortunately, nobody showed up for arrival on 12/06, and the reservations were charged first night room and tax for a no show."
"Comfortable beds, nice pool and hot tub. Computer room very handy since I didn't bring a laptop or iphone. Good fitness center. Great bonus was a coupon for a free full breakfast at next door's Denny's.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay!"
"Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile! We hope to offer you a stellar time next time you are in town."
"My husband and I recently stayed at the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines on our trip to Napa. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by a very helpful front desk clerk who made sure we had everything we needed. The rooms we clean and very nice. Overall I'd give this hotel a 100 and I'd definitely come again!Ronda S,We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Come back soon !"
"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon. Genafer, Director of Sales"
"great place to stay in a beautiful area of the country..highly recommended as a place to stay while in the napa/san Francisco area/////Denny's on property and very good size room for three adults very clean, excellent staffThank you for your review and I am glad you enjoyed your stay!"
"My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible."
"The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. We went to Napa to view the wineries and take a bike ride through the vinyards and then to San Francisco and off to Sonoma. Great location.We are so thrilled you had a great time in Napa. Please come see us again."
"I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event."
"Great location in Napa, CA. Check in was very good. Nice breakfast at Denny's. Room very clean, everything in working order. Upgraded because of my Diamond status. I will stay here again!! Nice restaurants in the area, downtown area.Debra, we are glad you had an enjoyable stay. Thank you for being a Diamond member of Best Western Rewards, we appriciate it. Rewards has it's perks, free upgrades, hot breakfast at Dennys, early check in and late check out when available. Come back and see us again."
"It is always the staff experience that provides to customers that's why I like staying at Best Western in Napa. They always do an extra mile and never forget to smile, even the housekeeping they are very polite and always with a smile when they greet you.Armandmariano C - Wow, thank you so much for such a kind review. I agree, the staff experience makes all the difference. Our staff here is stellar and I will make sure to share these kind words with all of them. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you again - Genafer, Director of Sales"
"As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!"
"The maids were very helpful room was excellent! Melinda at the front desk was terrific too! As I had stated I needed to check in earlier than 4pm mu room wasn't ready I had to wait an hour and a half."
"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area."
"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again."
"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu. There was ample parking with shopping and dining across the streetdavidsI8109CM - Thank you for the 5 Star review. It makes us so happy to that our guests have such a pleasant stay with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Cheers, Genafer"
"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away."
"We had a wonderful time. Aloft was beautiful. The staff helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and the amenities were very good. The beds were very comfortable. The location was really good for getting around the city.Doesn't get much better than that! Thank you for your kind words and we look forward to your next visit, Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
"We always enjoy staying at Aloft locations. They are unique, clean, and our teenagers love them! The hotel staff are always helpful and friendly. The downside is that you have to walk a bit to get to the tourist areas, but it is located downtown.Thanks so much for your loyalty to the Aloft Brand. See you again soon, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"Last minute trip to enjoy Christmas break. Location was great for walking everywhere. Went to a football and basketball game. The hotel staff is amazing. Scott was helpful all weekend. The rest of the staff were friendly, outgoing, and very knowledgeable about the area.That's what we like to hear!! Scott will be thrilled to hear he made an impact. Thanks for staying and we hope to see you again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both. We hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"Tried out Aloft for the ADA rooms. Pleasantly surprised spacious rooms updated features. We will look for the brand in our travels. The receptionist was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. I was waiting for the concierge to give a breakfast recommendation and she was busy so the receptionist gave us a few with different styles and directions turned out great. Thank you Aloft for a great stayDelighted to hear of your stay with us and appreciate your feedback on our ADA rooms. We hope you will stay with us again in the future,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
"No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"I have to say I had a great stay,...The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful....What more can you askThe bar down stairs was nice to have so you did not need to go out if you really didn't want to. They are located within dozen of place for Uber Eats if your staying in. Awesome! Thank's so much for choosing Aloft NOLA for your needs, we hope you'll be back again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"The rooms were very nice and spacious! The workers were friendly and very calm even though it was a big event going on in the city. The rooms were very clean and comfy beds. I enjoyed my stay overall.Clean and comfy is music to our ears. Thanks for the great review and we hope you get back to Aloft New Orleans Downtown!"
"This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway. Thanks for the kudos, see you next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!"
"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately.

"Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking. Not a happy camper...Sorry to hear of your disappointment with your room. We do realize those windowless rooms aren't for everyone. They are labeled when booking as Loft King Room but i'm not sure how your booking channel has that set up. If you would like, I'd be happy to take a look into that for you. We hope we have another opportunity to earn your business back please reach out to me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com or 504-312-7715.I hope to hear from you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!! I will be sure to share your kudos with her as well as our entire staff. Thanks for choosing ALOFT NOLA for your stay, we hope to see you again on your next visit.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"The title says it all. Felt it was well priced for a good location (walking distance to bourbon and Frenchmen), very spacious rooms which helps when traveling in groups. Good onsite breakfast options.Thanks so much for taking the time to share your feedback, we are thrilled to learn of your great experience. We hope we will be your go-to hotel in NOLA. See you next time, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"
"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
"New hotel, the rooms the lobby you notice that this is a new building. It was very clean, we enjoyed our room and the lobby.Staff was all friendly and the breakfast was good (usual Hampton Inn breakfast).Dear bens9,Thank you for your raving review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Great to hear you enjoyed our Hampton breakfast as well as our friendly staff. We hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."
"This was a very nice Hampton Inn. Lobby area is very nice. Negatives- Breakfast is very busy. Not enough seating. Food is just OK. Our room did not get cleaned until after 5PM. We just got back from all day wine tasting. Maids did not knock they just walked in."
"The staff is all very friendly, and facility was great! Over all a great experience. Everything for a family Vacation. Also there is a cute little farmers market and movie theater, and restaurants nearby."
"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!"
"Beautiful brand new hotel. The staff performs at 110. Great location everything you need is within 5 miles of this hotel. Comfortable room great service overperforming staff makes this hotel the best place to stay in Napa."
"I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you again, Serina Najar."
"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity."
"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."
"This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car."
"If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated. Many perks like cookies. tea, coffee in the lobby during the day, complimentary hot breakfast, and a snack bar to take with us to San Francisco. Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Definitely staying with us we offer many other perks like 24 hour complementary tea and coffee, in addition to cookies and our on the run breakfast to go bags that are available Mon-Fri 6am to 10am, just swing by the front desk and the bags are available for all our guest. Thank you again for visiting and we hope to see you again. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar."
"I really enjoyed my stay at the Hampton Inn and Suites Napa. The staff were very friendly and the facilities were excellent. There is a free buffet breakfast, wine tasting from 5-6pm and a tea/coffee station in reception all day. The pool is heated and the outdoor areas are really well maintained. I had a very relaxing stay and would definitely recommend it.Dear ACNolan,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar."
"This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new. It provides easy access to downtown Napa as well as to the main highway north to all the wineries. My room was on the ground floor, No. 130 and there was some noise from upstairs translated below but not bad. Also had really nice, big screen, TVs.Dear TSCClovisCa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your awesome feedback, compliments of our hotel's location and arthitectural features. Thank you again for staying with the Hampton Inn SUites Napa, we hope to serve you again in the near future."
"Hotel is in a great location for Napa and Sonoma wine tasting. Good breakfast and wine tasting from 5 to 6 pm in the lobby. Clean hotel with nice patio. Decent workout room and friendly staff make for a pleasant stay."
"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."
"My daughter and I went to Texas for a concert at the Verizon and chose this hotel based on location, reviews, and previous experience with Hampton Inn Suites. The mattresses were so comfortable and no evidence of bedbugs. The staff was great. The breakfast was delicious. I wish we could have stayed longer."
"Really nice hotel. Room was fresh and clean. Fluffy pillows and comfy bed. Housekeeping was good. I liked , the larger batheroom and shower, the coffee cubie in the bathroom, the shelf under the sink - I used it to tuck my toiletries away, Other notes - front desk person friendly and nice, complimentary breakfast was good and above average... More"
"I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat."
"We stayed with my family for 1 week.It was amazing time for relax in Dubai,especially in Marriott Marquis.Restaurants food are delicious,especially we recommend Izakaya and Garden.Cafe Artois is fantastic place with very nice view to Dubai Canal.Service of concierge Mustafa was super.He advised my family all iconic places of Dubai.Definitely we will be back soonWe want to thank you for staying at the Fairfield Inn Suites by Marriott Keys Collection and we are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your recent stay, your patronage is very important, and it means the world to us that you had a great stay."
"We were looking for a hotel at the last minute. As soon as we walk in the staff were very courteous and friendly, very helpful in finding the best pricing and fulfilling my hotel needs. I was serviced by Davian, she was very willing and helpful. I commended her for the outstanding service she provide. Next time we visit Key West this will be our place to stay.Dear Catherine A,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was very courteous and friendly. It is always nice to see our staff mentioned. We hope to see you back in Key West soon!Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay."
"Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends."
"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments. Steve is an amazing team member. He welcomes all of our guests with great libations and wonderful ideas on what to see and explore on the Island. Thanks for staying with us."
"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
"Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!"
"I stayed here with a couple friends. Very friendly hotel! The weather was terrible, cold rainy, in the Keys. The staff was super helpful in helping us find things to do. The location is far from all the action, but a quick cab ride away... worth the stay. Very clean.Thank you for sharing your comments with all of our trip adviser guests. I am sorry the weather did not cooperate on your recent trip to the Keys,you will need to come back to enjoy the Keys sunshine. Thank you for staying with us."
"The location wasn't exactly where i thought it was but that was partly my fault, there are 2 Fairfield's in Key west and I got confused with the second one. However it was nice and close to airport which is what I was looking for at first. The Hotel had a nice room, Clean, and everything you needed to just have a nice stay. They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice. It was just a nice hotel all around and we couldn't beat the price. Very happy with our stay here.Dear Ashley663,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us. We hope you had a relaxing time here in Key West and we hope to see you back in again soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
"I found my room + hotel to be just as advertized. Tnhe location puts you in easy walking distance of Wrigley Field.It is also very handy to both bus and L."
"I had looked into Villa Toscana before but it was completely full. Last week I lucked out. The location was convenient, the room was comfortable, the innkeeper helpful and the overall experience excellent. Definitely a place I would stay again."
"Spent four nights visiting in Seattle and a big part of the pleasure was staying at Bed and Breakfast Inn. I arrived late, which was no issue, since Shannon and I communicated via text. I got a quiet downstairs room, bath down the hall. All spotless, nice waffle-weave robe in the closet. Breakfasts were superior (sitting in the sunny kitchen... More"
"My family and I stayed here for a night, the front desk guy and girl that were there are super nice they treated us with a warm smile and made us feel at home! . Awesome customer service and also the breakfast that they had was very good as well and our bed was very comfortable and clean as well as the room. Everyone working there was very friendly ."
"Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating. We are reviewing your reservation with our booking partners to ensure that no other guest encounters a similar issue. Please feel free to let our front desk know during any future stays if we can do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. I hope we can see you back again very soon for what I am sure will be a better experience."
"Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean. I stood at this hotel due to work. I will be returning shortly and I will also tell my other co-workers to stay there. Thank you for a great stay.We are so glad our staff was able to make your time at WoodSpring Suites a great one. The WoodSpring Suites team strives to make your stay one you wont forget. Thank you for sharing your experience with us and we hope we get the privilege to serve you again soon."
"For the cost of this hotel, I was extremely surprised on how nice, clean and modern looking it was. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with anything we needed, but most importantly I felt comfortable there because it was safe and secure and the inside and outside was well kept. I also found out it was recently remodeled. Would def stay there again."
"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel."
"My wife had a birthday party at theHoliday Inn North Phoenix.The event we had was wonderfully planned by Phil McIlveen,the hotel's director of sales.He helped in planning a great party within our budget.Phil went above and beyond his limits to ensure that the event was successful.The staff were courteous and very ready to listen and help out wherever and whenever we needed them.We will surely have more events in the future at this location and we will send referrals to Phil.Thank you for the hospitality.George"
"It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke"
"The had a bad smell. It smells like wet carpet or maybe mildew."
"When I open the room I was amazed how great it was. The bed, the pillows, the sheets, the towels, the bath. I had no idea for the price what a great place I would get"
"It was great and staff were very friendly. Wish I could've stayed longer."
"Garbage hotel beware do not use the toxic water there if you shower in it you will smell like waste water"
"This hotel has bedbugs!! The staff acted like it wasn't a big idea!! Don't stay here!!"
"Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no \"hot\" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a \"sewer\" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out."
"Front desk staff was awesome. David was amazing, he was exceptional in providing quality customer service. Whenever we had a need, he was quick to assist and resolve. Housekeeping was excellent and maintenance too as they had to repair a socket. 5 stars!"
"I stay here frequently as a getaway. It is clean, quiet for the most part. They do allow dogs so just make sure there is not a dog in the room next door. However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel."
"After a long drive it was nice to come to a nice, comfortable hotel and a quiet one."
"Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean"
"we love this place. the staff is always very accomodating and the rooms are super cute. the remodeled rooms are our favorite but the other rooms are nice too. great place for the price."
"I love the front desk an the manager an the maintenance it was good which is why I was there in the first place because of the plumbing in my apartment i enjoyed the pool the colored lights was nice .Hello Faith, Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel 502. We are happy that you enjoyed your stay. Take care and hope to see you again in the near future."
"Horrible"
"it was great to have a nice big pool, i love the outside area and the patch of grass thats in there, o and have a breakfast thats way better then anything i can imagine thanks so much hope to book again,"
"It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4. By far my favorite hotel in the city!Thank you Daniel for the review! As always we love to host you at the Nolitan! Let us know when you will be back )Best Regards."
"Our first family reunion in Atl I was very happy with staff professionalism and friendliness to help with suggests. One family had a room problem and it was handled in a timely matter. I would recommend this hotel"
"This is a very clean hotel. The staff is always very friendly and extremely helpful! The breakfast is worth every penny and I would recommend trying the French toast. I stay here at least every six months and I am always very pleased with every aspect of my stay!"
"Highly recommend this hotel for the proximity to downtown Atlanta. Excellent room with very good daily service. The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. Not something you find in lower quality hotels."
"Spent a week here for work and the staff was wonderful. Very friendly and helpful. The do a wonderful job and make it very welcoming. I will return when I am back in town again. Location is nice with some good restaurants around."
"We had the most amazing stay! Not being from the area we didn't no much about the places around us so upon asking the front desk staff (Vanessa) we where given directions to everything we could need. Our time at the pool (conveniently we got roomed on the same floor as the pool) was amazing and much needed. Breakfast was... More"
"What a wonderful surprise this hotel was to us!! We were greeted by the front desk and treated like royalty. Although we had to wait a half hour til our room was ready, they made sure we were comfortable and gave us bottled water. The room was GREAT. A huge bathtub was a delight. I don't normally take a bath... More"
"I booked this hotel for our layover stay in Atlanta due to the proximity to the aquarium. Great hotel, extremely friendly and helpful staff, and the restaurant attached had amazing food! I highly recommend!"
"Our stay was made so special by the staff here. They went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and had all we needed. They were determined to make our anniversary weekend a memorable one. The facilities were all clean and the helpful staff was always smiling."
"Great stay - very satisfied and pleased with the quality! Very conveniently located and very nice indoor pool! It was January but the outdoor pool looked nice! As a courtesy because the room was not ready they gave us free breakfast and a movie - and a different great room. very clean and good service."
"This hotel was an excellent pick for the convenience and location that it was in. We stayed in the King City-view w/whirlpool and for the price it was worth every penny. What i didn't know was that the Braves had a game that weekend and the hotel was sold out...That didn't matter. The staff made us feel like we were... More"
"We stayed over a 3 day weekend. Can't beat the walk to the Aquarium, Childrens Museum and Olympic Park (2 good playgrounds for little ones) Valet parking was 32 bucks a night which we thought was a bit steep but it was very busy in the area surrounding the hotel so parking is scarce. Restaurant on site (Legal Seafood) had... More"
"The location of the hotel was great. It was just a short drive to turner field and right across the street from the aquarium and the coke museum.

"In town for a sizeable training conference and was able to compare my hotel with the four other approved locations. This one was tops in upkeep, housekeeping, staff and price. Recommend you make your reservation as soon as you know your dates and then keep checking up to 72 hours within check-in. That's how I saved half the original cost.... More"
"Our stay was fantastic, our room had a wonderful view of downtown Atlanta! Everyone was very hospitable, room was clean and comfortable. A special thanks to Mr. Gary Thomas for making sure the our stay was fantastic until the minute we pulled away from the hotel parking."
"Manager Orlando was very accommodating on the phone and allowed us to have a great time in downtown Atlanta. The hotel is in a superb location and is easy walking distance to the most touristy sites in downtown ATL."
"Within walking distance of major attractions.Rooms were clean and comfortable.Breakfast was simply delicious.The highlight for our family was how friendly all the staff were.Would stay there in a heartbeat.We went to the zoo and it started to pour,one of the desk ladies lent us her own umbrella,just blew us away."
"An excellent team to assist you. Opt for the valet parking. Nice rooms restaurant on site, front desk service available for your needs. Closest hotel to aquarium. Walking distance to Phillips arena. Well priced value for sure."
"The Hilton Garden Inn is in the heart of Centennial park. Walking distance to the College Football Hall Fame, World of Coke Cola, Aquarium, and the CNN center. Great restaurants right across the street, Stats, MAX pizza, Two BBQ. Not to mention Legal Seafood in the lobby of the Hilton Garden Inn. Awesome views of the sky line from the... More"
"My family took a quick trip to Atlanta to primarily visit the Aquarium. We chose this hotel for its proximity. We were delighted to have a room on the 12th floor facing Centennial Park. The sunrises and sunsets were beautiful, and the night view of the ferris wheel and city lights just lovely. The room was a standard 2 Queen... More"
"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym. We pride ourselves in service and i'm very happy to read you've enjoyed your stay. Hopefully we get to welcome you back again in the future!Warmest Regards, Nick HaferGeneral Manager"
"Only an overnight stay this time but I know I will be back. The room was perfect as always. I was on the 5th floor in a king superior room. I had no view although it didn't matter at all. We had drinks on the patio outside the bar and it was extremely pleasant. Dinner at Atlas was superb and... More"
"I LOVE this hotel... I've been traveling to Atlanta for work recently and it is uber convenient for me in a lovely neighborhood. But more than that, I feel super welcome and comfortable here. The staff is lovely and friendly and helpful. On my last stay I had a minor issue and got a personal email from manager apologizing- they... More"
"I can't begin to describe how incredible this hotel is!! Service was beyond my expectations. Their devotion to 100 satisfaction was evident everywhere we went from the bar, the pool, room service, check-in/check-out, and valet. I am proud that my city has such a hotel to represent!!! I most definitely will return!"
"A great classic hotel with old world charm and character and some great service from all the staff I interacted with. I stayed here for a week and this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in for some time. Large plush, quite rooms, attentive service, a good gym and good food in a handy location near Buckhead....

"We stayed here in November and had a wonderful stay. The restaurant, room service, bar and spa are amazing! Worth every penny and a place to experience! The shrimp and grits breakfast item is amazing!"
"I love this place when the room rates are reasonable. The entire property is very upscale and the rooms are very spacious. This hotel makes you feel like you are on vacation while you are doing business. There is a terrific bar including outdoor seating when the weather cooperates. There are also several very good restaurants just outside the back... More"
"Our experience at the St.Regis was great! All the staff was so attentive, nice and helpful. Valet was very helpful and nice those guys don't get the tips and credit they deserve!

"I was quoted a price over the phone of 383 weekly and even used my credit card to hold the room. On the day of check in i arrived and my room wasn't even ready even after 5pm then I was told that room would be over 500 per week and i couldn't afford that. All the man at the... More"
"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager"

"Swiftly cleaned rooms just like most hotels. The staff are the best part about staying here. Shawn and Bianca N. are my favorites. Without hesitant, go to the moon and back to make sure you feel at home. It's hard to find that at other branches in Metro Atlanta. Bianca N. and Shawn are the Dynamic duo. Whether you need something as small as dishes to needing a laugh. They are the perfect ones.Chanel, thank you for making Extended Stay America -Atlanta - Clairmont a part of your travel plans. We are delighted your stay with us was exceptional and that our associates exceeded all of your expectations. I will share your wonderful compliments with Shawn and Biance. Thank you for being our guest, and we look forward to that next visit.Sincerely,General Manager"
"Entire staff was both accommodating and extreemly pleasant. Room was very clean and quiet. I recommend this hotel and plan to stay there when I visit Atlanta later in the new year. The only thing that could be improve upon is to serve a full breakfast buffet YUM!I want to thank you for taking the time to post a review of your stay. It is pleasing to know you were well accommodated by our staff and that you would recommend our hotel. Thank you again for your review. It would be our pleasure for you to repeat your experience with us in the future."
"We stayed in a King Suite for 4 nights over the July 4th weekend. I can hardly express how good and positive our stay was. Breakfast was very good.

They have a complimentary shuttle bus to take you to the tourist spots. The best was the pool which is opened 24 hours! We did a day of sightseeing and then relaxed and had... More"
"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley"
"Location great. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Room great. Staff very helpful. Lee, the lovely lady who first saw us when we booked in couldn't have been more helpful. She gave us lots of information about Seattle and was extremely friendly and helpful. Lee went above and beyond in customer service."
"We stayed for 1 night for the Pearl Jam show , great friendly staff , all the amenities you need , cool retro rooms.Awesome location, a short stroll to Pike Place Market.Will stay again on our next trip to Seattle for sure !!Hey Harry!Thanks SO SO much for the great review. It was a pleasure having the two of you stay with us and getting to chat Pearl Jam and old Seattle rock. It would be great to see you two down from BC again soon!Cheers until then,David Bayley"
"We really enjoyed our overnight stay here. The bed was comfortable. It was clean and quiet. The location is nice and close to the freeway with a lot of food choices close by. We were able to bring our dog, too! Recommended."
"We had 4 rms for family reunion. Our stay was a great experience. All our family needs and requests were met and service exceeded our expectations. The rms were clean and restful. The kids had a balst in the pool and breakfast exceeded our needs. Great job tonthe intire staff in Arizona"
"The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix."
"We checked in late on Friday night. The desk clerk was very friendly and quick to help us get checked in. The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay."
"Front desk/service personnel were very friendly, room was very clean, AC unit worked very well and breakfast was one of the best of all the La Quinta's I have stayed. Highway 10 access is fast and several gas stations plus fast food restaurants are within 1/4 mile."
"I stay at this hotel for 2 weeks. And the staff was always very up beat and friendly and always ready to help. The Hotel was clean inside and out. There was always fresh cookie at the front desk along with a smile on the stuff person no matter who the person was behind the counter."
"The staff made it a very enjoyable stay. After check in the front desk clerk made fresh cookies and lemonade. The rooms were very clean and fresh smelling. The breakfast was very good and fresh. Will stay on our return trip."
"my experience here at la quinta was amazing when i visited pheonix. i recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay at an affordable price. their services were great and so was the scenery and other things about th eroom and hotel."
"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team"
"this has been our 4 or 5 th time we have stayed here for about 4 weeks and as always if not better our stay was excellent.Still miss our morning hugs from the staff at breakfast,hope to see you all next year. H"
"This is a nice LaQuinta hotel. We came back from Bearazona wildlife park after going there with our dogs Timmy and Peanut. They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles."
"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay. If you would like to further discuss your visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hotel Manager, Massimiliano Puglisi, directly at Massimiliano.PuglisiRosewoodhotels.com. If you give us a chance to earn back your trust, I can assure you that we will do our best to give you the great hotel experience that so many of our guests have grown so fond of. Wishing you all the best!Sincerely, The Carlyle Family"
"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square. It's our pleasure to accommodate you and we appreciate your praise. Jessica is an excellent member of our team. She always goes above and beyond for our guests. You can see why we love having her here so much!We're looking forward to sharing another amazing experience with you soon. Have a beautiful day!"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. The cleanliness of the facility was also great. We have stayed at the Westin a few times and will continue in the future."
"Bad: Nothing so far. Good: Perfect location to see the city. The hotel is comfortable, clean and spacious and excellent value for money. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"Bad: No on site Spa Services, concierge was unable to give us any well thought out options. We secured our own Spa appointments."
"Bad: Everything was so good!! None!. Good: Everything! Oh my! What a view! Staff was wonderful, Bed pillow soft!! Food delicious! Access to so much! Perfect stay!! Next time I plan on coming with my husband so he can experience this wonderful place! He is a big Cub fan! He will love the Westin Inn North Chicago too!"
"Bad: The only thing that makes me upset is the rate for car parking 70 dollars crazy but i went with it still a great place. Good: The hotel was wonderful the rooms very roomy the view fantastic 15th floor"
"This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"
"I wanted to surpirse my boyfriend by not having to go home after picking him up from the airport and everything about the hotel was PERFECT. The location and hotel didn't feel like we were in Phoenix, and we live here!We're so happy to hear you had a wonderful time! Please visit again soon."
"We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon."
"Industrial vibe, very new. Comfortable rooms. Fair value. Good location. Other food and coffee options in walkable distance. Ate breakfast onsite two mornings -- the menu is diverse and creative with good prices.Thank you Joel! We're happy to hear you had a great stay. We hope to welcome you again in the future."
"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon."
"Brilliant design, great and thoughtful creative art. Service was the same. Creative bar menu, knowledgeable bartenders, especially Maxwell. Room- well designed, interesting design with iron industrial structures. Bathroom with double sided sink, large walk in shower is great. Loved the Bass Egg Bluetooth speaker was a surprise bonus. Try out Found:Re!Thank you Douglas for this amazing review! We're so happy to hear you had a great experience. We hope to see you again soon!"
"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team. Next time you book your reservation, please reach out to me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com and I'll make sure you are set-up in a room without a connecting room. We hope to see you again soon!Thanks!"
"I stayed in 809, and it was an absolute blast. The view and overall feeling of the suite exactly what I needed. Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon."
"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon."
"Our whole experience here was really positive. Rooms were clean, comfy and cosy with some fun artwork. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The food at the downstairs restaurant was delicious too and parking was really easy. Would thoroughly recommend.Thank you for this amazing review Melissa! We hope you will visit again soon."
"The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words! We look forward to seeing you again!"
"This hotel is a hip, slick, cool hotel and a great price! Exposed pipes and beams, funky lights, great walk in shower with a shower and mirror in the shower! The food is locally sourced and fabulous! Artwork everywhere in the hotel. Close to downtown and light rail from the airport takes you right to the front door - stay here!!!We're so happy to hear you had a great stay! Come back soon."
"My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"
"I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix."
"Fantastic place to stay! Unique environment combined with excellent service to make the perfect location to stay. There was a level of service here that I have not experienced anywhere else in Phoenix. I will definitely return and recommend to other travelers.Thank you so much! We're happy to hear you had a great stay!"
"Great spot! Hip Chic hotel with good service. Rooms were very nice with unique steel construction. Restaurant was delicious and the location was great. Light rail stop right in front of the hotel. Highly recommend!Thank you so much! We hope to have you back soon."
"Had a great time, amazing place. Will definitely be returning. Did some hiking while we were there and had some great food. Great Decor and very friendly people. Like I said in the title, I highly recommend this place.Hi robertrykal, Thank you for sharing your experience with us! I'm so glad to hear you had a chance to enjoy our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant Lounge! Make sure you take advantage of our great summer rates so we can see you again soon!Have a great day!"
"We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island. From the bottom of my heart thank you for been so sweet with me.During check out, Joy, was so understandable with me and my group. Sorry for making you separate the reservation balance in 4 credit cards.

"My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay."
"Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have. Also, it's a great location, close to anything you'd need.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"This hotel was fantastic. The hotel is clean and organized. The staff are very helpful, patient and know their jobs well. I was on my own with my son and the staff recommended top places to visit, as well giving me suggestions in saving some money too. Mary-Angeles, Joy, Patrick, Adriana, Domi, Catalina, Ashley--- Oh boy I could go on! Genuine people who treat you like you are part of a family. I will always come back here again. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone. We had a wonderful time here and the memories we made are precious. There are not enough words to describe just how caring the people here at this hotel.

"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone."
"Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay here again whenever I am in Anaheim, great hotel for a great price."
"Nice suite with 2 bedrooms fold out couch- was great to have 3 separate places to sleep, for 3 guys in town for LA Angels vs Red Sox baseball game.. Great ideal location for ballpark access- w/ parking included easy walk to ball field. Great breakfast. Best value for suite of any hotel i stayed in over my week in California. All rooms in suite were clean nice. (Would also be good for family going to nearby disneyland)We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"We were very pleased with this place. Helpful staff, big, clean, comfortable suite. 2BR suite was perfect for 2 adults 2 kids. (No breakfast, but it was a pleasant stroll to both Carl's Starbucks - can't complain!) Great deal for the - would definitely stay here again."
"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium."

"The two bedroom suites worked out very well for kids. Staff of hotel were very helpful. Close to Disney and other attractions. Reasonably priced."
"Having a full kitchen is a great feature and breakfast included is a nice way to start the day. Our room was close to the office and that worked out well for us. Our only complaint was that the bathroom door, room 202, did not lock. All staff were very friendly anf helpful. A schedule for the shuttle would have helped and notification that there is a senior rate for the shuttle.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

"We spent 3 days at this hotel, whilst at a convention at the Anaheim Convention Center and at Disneyland. Although this is not the closest hotel property to either, it is the best as far as hospitality and professionalism go. We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk. The smiling and professional service that she provided is what one would expect at a Ritz Carlton or St. Regis property. Note to management: You should hold on to and value employees like Adilene.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your 5 star review. I am glad to hear that Adi and our team were able to give you 5 star service during your visit to Anaheim.I hope to see you on our next Disneyland Adventure! Hospitably,Greg WilliamsGeneral Manager"
"This is a great Marriott property if you want to be close to the baseball game.

"We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels. I highly recommend this hotel to families with young children, we were very impressed."
"We were extremely satisfied with our stay. They have an excellent breakfast which we enjoyed everyday we were there. The rooms have everything you need for an extended stay. Everything you would need for cooking and serving meals, plus a full size refrigerator, microwave, stove and oven. Very comfortable room. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.

"We had a 15 night stay and this was perfect. There was great restaurants nearby and the kitchenette is great to make things in your room and save on meals. The staff was very accomodating and supported any requests that we made. PArticularly when we needed an extra night and they were oversold. Aric was a gem constantly checking on how we were doing when he saw us on the property and assisting with some printing needs when the lobby printer was tied up and I needed to get some things mailed ASAP. I definately recommend this hotel if you are going to Disney or looking to attend an Angels game.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you so much for your wonderful review.

"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff."
"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend."
"The owner of The Hotel Storyville went above and beyond to help us put on a birthday party in the garden. The evening was a great success. The rooms were clean and well-furnished, and the location can't be beat."
"This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!! We even had to call the police one night!!!!Just dont go to that place ever!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us."
"Great place right in the middle of the north end. Literally on Hanover street Room was clean and looked brand new. There is no parking so we stayed at haymarket garage and walked 5 minutes. Check in at restaurant"
"The location for this hotel is great right in the middle of the North End and close walking distance to Faneuil Hall, etc. modern efficient with large TV and electric fireplace. Very nice bathroom with standup shower but lacking in horizontal surfaces for toiletries."
"Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too. The bar remains open until midnight and is a great place to unwind after visiting the city."
"overnight in walking distance of subway , parks and downtown. Staff was very helpful. Good value for the money"
"Arriving after a long flight, it was a delight to find such a tranquil, beautiful haven. My room was large and full of lovely antiques and there was everything a tired traveller could wish for. I've already recommended it to a friend."
"Unbeatable location next to Newbury street. Lovely clean, comfortable room with amenities . Generous continental breakfast. Coffee and tea always available (often with delicious cookies) Very friendly helpful staff. Very easy to come and go as they give you the code. Third time staying here.Thank you for your kind words. We always enjoy seeing you and your family! Looking forward to welcoming you again!"
"If you are looking for a hotel near the French quarter and want luxury and service - this is the hotel for you. All rooms were clean, a good size and beautiful.The staff were so helpful and we are in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very helpful staff.When we come to New Orleans again this hotel is a must for us.SandGT,Thank you for taking time to leave feedback on our hotel! We take pride in giving excellent service for everyone who walks through our hotel, and are happy to hear that you loved your stay with us, as well as the helpfulness of the staff! The Food Beverage team will be thrilled to hear of your love of the food as well! We are lucky to work in a historic property in its prime location, but know that without a consistent level of top notch service our guests would choose one of the many other options nearby. Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!"
"This is a beautiful, clean, well-maintained hotel located one block off of Bourbon Street. We had a first floor room--presumably loudest in terms of street noise, but apart from hearing people in the lobby checking in or out, it was incredibly quiet! The bathroom is tiny but very clean, the towels are plush and large, the bedding is luxurious. The... More"
"We had an amazing time at the Cornstalk Hotel. Ms.Sharon was wonderful. The hotel is a lovely old New Orleans style. It's cozy and romantic. I look forward to going back for another visit. We went for our 25th Anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it extra special. Thank you!"
"Beautiful place near Bourbon Street but quiet. Staff was warm and welcoming, rooms were very clean and full of charm. Would recommend to anyone. Very close to restaurants and other places to visit. Great trip. Thank you"
"One of the best places you will ever stay in New Orleans. Absolutely delightful and right in the middle of the quarter but far enough away from the noise. This exceptional Hotel has been around for a very long time and there is a reason. Pure beauty and fabulous staff."
"I loved my stay at Cornstalk. The atmosphere is very family-like and personal. Shay was amazing, made cookies and made me feel like family. The big chain hotels can't compete with how the Cornstalk Hotel makes you feel at home, even when your thousands of miles away from home."
"Was in an old 1800's house, hotel has 14 rooms only, rooms are small but we'll appointed. Room 101 is known as the Elvis Room, he stayed here during a filming on one of his movies."
"Great stay overall, the room was supposed to have a balcony but it wasn't open. Will definitely go again if we get the chance though."
"We stayed here for a night and absolutely loved it. The hotel staff were courteous, helpful, and very personable. The only thing we could suggest is that they could have something other than water for their guests to drink. Other than that (and that wasn't really a big deal at all), everything was splendid."
"This hotel is perfect for being close to everything, but that is all it is perfect for. We had a cockroach in our room the last night we stayed there, and thank god it was the last night. They clearly do not have a pest control contract that treats the place for roaches regularly enough. I could see the lights... More"
"Just have to give this hotel a thumbs up for making a great visit to the French Quarters even better. The workers were hospitable, friendly, and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. We stayed in the two bedroom suite, and for the value, it was just right. The room was clean, everything was... More"
"This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included"
"The staff is outstanding, and they helped us with directions and where to go for awesome food, etc. Rooms are large and clean. Pool is very nice, and it's located just close enough to the French Quarter to have fun but also sleep in a nice, quiet hotel when you've had enough fun! Loved this place!!"
"Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back."
"From all outside appearance this facility is closed for remodeling as well as restaurants. Great location. Hope it is open on my next visit to NOLA. Lots of eating places in the area. Have to do minimum of 200 characters but not sure what more I can add to IT'S CLOSED!!!!"
"I was really happy with my experience at this hotel! I stayed here for a weekend in August. The room was nice and extremely clean. The staff was incredibly friendly. I loved the bathroom and it had a great shower. Right outside the hotel is a stop for the streetcar so its in a great location too. Absolutely no complaints... More"
"Pontchartrain Hotel has friendly service and guest rooms that are beautifully appointed to the smallest detail to ensure luxury and comfort. The beds are lavishly comfy the bedding luxurious. The public rooms are opulent and welcoming. The homemade ginger beer was better than fever tree (my favorite) The bartenders are first-rate and the view from the rooftop are is magnificent.... More"
"First thing totally rude staff!! Front desk check in took a hour! Hidden 125 fee.. i booked trip advisor all fees payed i thought. Okay now to the hotel .. Dirty! Throw up in pool so we couldnt swim.. throw up in iceroom which is a empty piss smelled closet, could go on.. i wont!"
"Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS"
"When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge."
"I am not the kind of person who would write reviews, but this time I have to, this is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life, the room smelled, was too mosit and had a lot of small flies. Overall everything is just disgusting, Worst experience ever!!!!!"
"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse"
"The Interior Renovations and design are very nice. Very comfortable and quite."
"I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again."
"NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all."
"I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel. We paid over 500 for 2 nights so it was not exactly a budget option. The room was the worst I have ever experienced.... More"
"stayed for a birthday party on the 26th DEC. SAL at the front desk was amazing!!!!! he is so sweet and his service was completely very welcoming. Anything we needed or had questions about SAL was the guy to go to. he knew all the area asked what we liked and made sure our car was there without waiting. All others at the front desk were not as professional and were not courteous. there was a big difference in service. SAL made it feel like we were in Vegas very professional. I will be coming back again ONLY if SAL is there. ME and my Husband luv the place. Thank you SAL!!!!"
"Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again ."
"I booked last min, the night before. It showed Family Suite. It was still cheaper then most everything in the area. Booked on TripAdvisor reviews and location. Checkin was at 3pm, as shown. There was a small glitch with my room key working, but they ran a new key to me while I was at the door. The room was... More"
"Great remodel, rooms were super clean and well cared for and the lobby was nice. Perfect for trips to Disney parks."
"This is a great hotel walking distance to Disneyland friendly staff clean rooms great price will stay again"
"My family had an amazing experience. We arrived early and staff had a room ready for us. The walk to the tram is very short.. breakfast was good but would preffered scramble eggs and potatoes. The only problem was the parking, but staff made it easy to find one for us. Thanks for all the help!!!"
"On short notice, my boyfriend I decided to pop down for a short trip during Disneyland's off-season. Because it wasn't the busy season, we decided to try out a different Best Western (we usually stay at the Best Western Park Place Inn). This Best Western had a great location, it's just right around the corner from the parking areas.... More"
"All employees were very helpful and polite"
"Nice hotel, friendly staff, clean rooms, good included breakfast, nice pool and VERY close to the parks (5 minutes walk). Can totally recommend. We had the suite, and it was perfect for a family of five."
"This is truly my home away from home. Good complimentary breakfast that holds my family off until lunch. Breakfast includes waffles, muffins, toast, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, biscuit and gravy depending on day, fruit, yogurt, hard boil eggs, and cereal. Everyone is really friendly. I have been going here for years and stay 5-6 times a year. The... More"
"I have stayed at a lot of hotels through the years while vacationing at Disneyland, this hotel and its employees were wonderful. Great food service by Manuel and Vira they were the tops. I would recommend this hotel to all..."
"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business."
"Anyone that's looking for a great hotel chain with fantastic customer service, professional, great prices in Atlantic City New Jersey The Best Western Envoy is the place where you will feel right at home.Overall I only use Best Western Hotel/motels whenever I travel. Excellent breakfast, excellent rooms, amenities decor location Best Western Hotels should be your number one choice. Thank you for staying at Best Western Envoy Inn, Atlantic City NJ. We are thrill to hear that you really enjoyed your stay. Yes we have fresh waffles for breakfast along with hard boiled eggs, sausage, many more items. Thank you for your feedback. It means a lot to us."
"Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size"
"Staff was very friendly and helpful!!! Good location, couple blocks from outlet shops and 3min walk to the beach and board walk. Neighborhood is not the best at night. But it is a good place to stay overall."
"This hotel had an ant problem, was extremely loud, we found hair on our towels, and someone else was given the key to our room at midnight. NEVER AGAIN! We stayed at several Best Westerns on our vacation, this was by far the WORST."
"spacious, clean room, relatively close to boardwalk, a 7eleven across the street... not prime location (you feel that Atlantic city is not in its best days), but good value (even with the charges for parking) as it is walking distance to boardwalk/beach and the room is nice"
"Seriously security is too bed!! Some one stole my stuff in my car!!"
"We stay here everytime we're in town for the Supercross and it's a really nice place to stay! The room is really clean and the beds are really comfortable. We'll definitely continue staying here when in town."
"We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip. Most hotels were sold out in the area, so we were pleasantly surprised to find comfortable, clean, and hospitable accommodations. We loved the location, which was within a couple miles of Old Town San Diego. If we ever need to return, I... More"
"Very nice room, comfortable bed with good HD TV. Nice amenities and also good if you have children with you. Rooms are quiet and well maintained. It is right off the interstate and short drive to almost everything you could be looking for in San Diego."
"front desk was awesome, housekeeping was awesome, the only thing was the last night of our stay, the security guard asked to check our room out for absolutely no reason we were about to go to bed and were being quiet...we had the same 3 people we had had the whole time and he said interesting and walked out, nothing else happened and we went to bed....VERY strange...other than that I loved this hotel and we will be retuning!!!"
"Ok, I know it's San Diego, Hotel Circle, but this hotel makes you feel like you're on an island somewhere far away. The landscaping is lush and almost tropical. It's far larger than it looks from the street. The rooms are a bit small, but they're still confortable with all the amenities except microwave...but I didn't miss that. And I... More"
"This is a terrific hotel. I make it a point to stay here every trip to San Diego. The grounds are beautiful and the amenities are great! Ask about the PG program. The PG lounge is awesome! The staff is eager to help in any way,"
"Did not sleep.. sadly when we arrived this hotel was directly the msin hotel affected by the construction and its crew, that was performed during the whole night, made our short trip to the beach a sadly terrible one"
"I was very apprehensive about staying here having read some reviews and have come to the conclusion that only complainers write reviews. We had a wonderful stay in a cheerfully lit spotless room, with gracious staff which was also an excellent value The rates even went down and we were offered the lower rate. I would gladly stay here again... More"
"We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment."
"We were greeted by Yadira and she was very accommodating and very friendly, we felt at home right from the get go. The room was very clean. The hotel staff made sure all our needs were met. We all had very satisfied tummies with their free breakfast. We'll definitely be staying here again!!!"
"This hotel exceeded all my expectations. It is conveniently located and a short drive to everything San Diego has to offer. Marcia and Elisa at the front desk were incredibly helpful and friendly making my stay all the better. They went out of their way to answer any questions and make recommendations as to what to see. Thanks again!"
"I cannot say enough about this outstanding hotel. Everything was top notch! The valets and front desk went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, easy and memorable! La Jolla is so beautiful and upon our return we will only stay at this amazing property!"
"We wanted to take a quiet moment to thank you and the staff at the Grande Colonial for an extraordinary stay. The staff was professional and attentive, the facility had old world charm with modern amenities and the food and drinks were a delight.Thank you, Jccwins. We appreciate you taking the time to post feedback here on TripAdvisor. Our staff and the warm, gracious, and genuinely-friendly service they provide is our greatest asset. And I am so happy to see that reflected in your review. We look forward to welcoming you back again in the future. Best regards, Terrence Underwood, General Manager"
"My boyfriend and I had a most excellent stay here! We checked in on this past Sunday and stayed until this Tuesday. From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful! I commend who ever does the hiring here because they have done a Fantastic job of hiring people that either love their job and sincerely want you to enjoy your stay or they do a great job in faking it LOLrnrnHotel is located within walking distance of all the quaint shops, it has it's own restaurant but we were not impressed with the menu... we did however take advantage of the happy hour deal the appetizers were tasty and 1/2 off as was their signature cocktail Orange Crush. The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo. Parking on the street down the hill is free so don't spend the 22.00 on valet just find a spot on the street.rnrnRespectfully Reviewedrn"
"We had a wonderful 5 day stay here! We enjoyed everything about this hotel. The staff was friendly, housekeeping was great, the grounds were well kept and constantly being worked on while we were there. The breakfast was exceptional. Its close to beaches and San Diego attractions I would absolutely recommend this Marriott and stay here again and again. Thanks for a great stay!Thanks for the top score review. I am confident that future travelers to San Diego and to our hotel will find your review very helpful. Please come back and see us again in the future.Regards,Jonathan CorrellGeneral Manager"
"Great place to stay, Justin at the front desk gave us a warm welcome. Our room was really nice and clean. We really appreciated the service that Maria our breakfast attendant gave us during our morning.Dear Rafa2408,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay, I 'am delighted to hear you enjoyed your suite and the service our staff provided. We work extremely hard to ensure we provide exceptional service to each and every guest. I will ensure I give Justin his kudos for the service he provided!

We are happy to hear you enjoyed your stay. Please come again the next time you are in town."
"We booked this stay using Marriott points so we would be close to the airport for an early morning flight. The evening staff were very gracious. We were booked for the morning shuttle and paid to leave our car in the lot rather than park at the airport. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a Ruby Tuesday across... More"
"We alway stay at Hyatt whenever we finish Orlando trip before our next day flight. Check in and out were as smooth as usual, The room is quite large for 3 of us spreading our luggages, and it is also very clean. The kids were fancinated by the newly installed bathroom in-mirror clock."
"I am staying at this hotel for business and it has exceeded expectations! Absolutely gorgeous, great location, superb amenities, super comfy bed.....I could go on and on. If you're visiting New Orleans STAY HERE.....you won't be disappointed!Jessie, Thank you for your great review on TripAdvisor. Your recommendation means a lot to us and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaire General Manager"
"We booked Nopsi for my 40th birthday and this hotel lived up to my expectations. My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel. Your comments to location and staff are gratefully received and we hope to welcome you back soon.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"Close to parade routes, walking distance to the French Quarter but not in the middle of it it! Nice roof top bar and pool and view of the New Orelans areas. Would definitely stay hear again when New Orleans."
"I have never been treated so badly in my entire life. I have called this people so many times to ask questions regarding friends comin over for as me have in a lil get together. An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit. We take very seriously any complaints of discrimination, any forms of which are not tolerated in our company. As the hotels General Manager, I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue with you, and also address and clarify your concerns regarding pool usage and rooftop access. My e-mail address is elemairenopsihotel.com and you can reach me via phone at 504.962.6512.Warm regards, Ellen LeMaire"
"We stayed at the NOPSI Hotel for the LSU game at the Dome. It was a wonderful surprise! It was an easy walk to the Dome from the hotel. The hotel was beautiful! Our room and the bed was fantastic! The staff couldnt have been nicer or more accommodating! We couldnt have been more pleased. Will definitely stay here again on our next trip to The Big Easy!!Thank you for choosing NOPSI! It's a pleasure to learn the numerous things that made your time with us unforgettable. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future. Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and we look forward to having you stay with us again.Best regards,"
"This hotel is perfectly located..close enough to walk to the action but far enough way to not be apart of all the hustle and bustle...the hotel is fashionably decorated, comfortable, and the staff is very accommodating! The roof top bar was everything, especially at night!"
"Exceed my expectation! The place was amazing. The rooms were very clean, hotel employees were extraordinarily kind. They answered all questions and directed us to the some great local places. I will definitely stay here again.Our goal is to exceed the expectations of our guests, it's always exciting to read when our guests tell us we did. Thank you for recognizing all the efforts of the team, we look forward to your next visit. Wayne General Manager"
"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and do hope to have you stay with us again.Best regards"
"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,"
"You do not want to miss this gem! From the moment you enter the front door to the time you leave the experience is like none other in NOLA. Beautiful hotel, great staff, rooms are perfectly cozy and a little like Vegas. Rooftop bar ambiance is clutch with a great view! Quiet and perfectly locatedThank you so much for taking the time to share this rave review of our hotel. We love hearing compliments such as this and how our property, service, and amenities created such a wonderful experience. It was our pleasure to have you as our guests and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,"
"Wonderful hotel located in the heart of the quarters. Walking distance to everything, drinks as you walk out of the hotel lobby, friendly staff. Enjoyed my Mardi Gras experience by staying here... ...Thank you for taking the time to share your comments. Mardi Gras is an amazing experience here in the Big Easy and we are excited we were able to be part of yours. We look forward to seeing you again very soon! Wayne General Manager"
"For someone who had never visited New Orleans before, I could confidently say that the troubadour staff made me feel like I was at home. I was told about all of the fantastic restaurant and bars that weren't tourist traps. The front desk staff provided quite a bit of useful information about the city and were a fantastic resource that answered all of my questions. My room was always immaculate and the housekeeping team was able to accommodate all of my requests. I look forward to my next stay soon.Thank you for sharing your experience. We are excited you spent your first trip to the Big Easy with us. I'm very proud of the team here at The Troubadour and always enjoy reading when guest recognize all their efforts. Can't wait to see you on your next trip to NOLA!WayneGeneral Manager"
"My husband and I decided to head South to spend our April 2018 birthdays in New Orleans. Our stay at the Troubadour was perfect. The entire staff (especially Jalen at the front desk and bellman) made our trip memorable and worth a return stay. This will be our home away from home whenever we're visiting New Orleans. Oh, and the buffet was simply marvelous!Thank you very much for choosing The Troubadour to celebrate your birthdays with us and we are delighted to know you had such a great time. We will be sure to share this among our team so they know their efforts did not go unnoticed and we do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"The hotel was very clean and the staff was great! My friends and I booked this hotel for my birthday trip and we would definitely stay again. It's near the heart of the city, The French Quarters, and neatly hidden at the same time.Thank you for sharing and Happy Birthday! No better place to spend it then the Big Easy and we appreciate you allowing us to be part of it. Thank you again! Wayne General Manager"
"Staff was friendly... Clean room... great location... will definitely stay again. Right by the Superdome.. Not far from everything else. No ice machine on your floor but staff brings ice to ur room quickly. Again great stay."
"The Troubadour is a hotel that is clearly run by seasoned professionals. It is modern and beautifully appointed. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The room was spacious, the bed incredibly comfortable , the bathroom had every amenity and the largest and nicest shower imaginable. The rooftop bar was lively, had a great view, drinks and DJ. It is a short walk to the French Quarter. Do not hesitate to stay there!Thank you for taking time to complete a review of your recent stay. I'm thrilled to hear you had an enjoyable stay. We know you have a lot of choices when selecting a place to stay and appreciate having had the opportunity to impress you. Thank you for the recognition and recommendation, we look forward to seeing you again soon.WayneGeneral Manager"
"Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy! We always strive to exceed the expectations of our guests and I'm proud to be working with such a great team. Thank you for recognizing all their efforts. We look forward to seeing you again for next years marathon if not sooner, the Crescent City is coming up soon!Thank youWayne General Manager"
"Lovely hotel with an amazing rooftop bar. The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color. Bellmen and concierge were very helpful with good advice for where to go. It's in walking distance of Bourbon St but wear comfortable shoes There is lots of walking and sidewalks are uneven most everywhere you go. Of course, taxis and Uber are available. Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. Happy Birthday!!! We appreciate you sharing your comments for others to get a feel of The Troubadour and our Monkey Board rooftop bar, we are excited to hear you enjoyed the atmosphere up there. The team will enjoy reading your comments and we thank you for recognizing all their hard efforts. We look forward to seeing you again soon, at least before your next birthday!WayneGeneral Manager"
"This was a very nice hotel. Great location. Staff nice and professional. One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time. I do recommend to your review readers and I will stay there again.Thank you for the wonderful review and recognizing the efforts of our hard working team here at The Troubadour. We appreciate that you took a few minutes to share your experience for others to appreciate. It's always nice to read what our guests have to say. We look forward to your next visit.WayneGeneral Manager"
"This hotel was awesome the rooms were great the staff was awesome the location was perfect the only draw back to this hotel is the 40 for valet parking however there are other cheaper options close to the hotel the roof top bar was really cool the breakfast was excellent overall the hotel gets a 97 out of 100 score from meThank you so much for taking the time to share this great review of your stay and we are delighted to know how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. There are cheaper options of parking around the area which is due to them having less labor and security costs than ours but yes they are conveniently located should guests decide to utilize those options. Your business and feedback are very important to us and we look forward to having you stay with us again whenever your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,"
"Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish."
"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,"
"The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"Very pretty hotel. There was Wonderful lady at the check in desk and she handled everything with ease. We had a little bit of an issue but she was so great she didnt make it an issue. The room was spacious and quiet. Everyone and I mean everyone was helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar called The Monkey Board was so terrific. Saturday night was a fun dance party and Sunday afternoon we enjoyed the sun and had some of the most delicious crawfish i have ever had. Thank you so much for this fantastic review of your stay and please know that it has been shared among our team. Chef Dana will be thrilled to know how much you enjoyed his crawfish and its always nice to hear when the team exceeds all expectations of our guests.We appreciate you staying with us and look forward to always being your hotel of choice in New Orleans.Best regards,"
"The Troubadour is excellent. Clean, secure and accommodating. All are super friendly and helpful. Quiet, felt safe and the extra was coffee, hot and ready, in the lobby each morning. Centrally located.Thank you for the great review, we look forward to your next visit. Wayne General Manager"
"As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans. It sounds like our property and service provided exceeded all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Carl will be commended for his efforts in going above and beyond to ensure you were well taken care of and we look forward to having you back as our guest very soon.Best regards,"
"Loved the unique ultra modern design! All the employees we interacted with were very pleasant and accommodating. Looking forward to returning to the property to spend a little more time there to explore the Monkey Board rooftop lounge.Dear 200Williamsf, many thanks for your super nice comments about this new and fun life style hotel in The Big Easy! We can't wait for your return for another Monkey Board rooftop bar and dj music experience. Ron Olstad, General Manager"
"Very good , all excellent, TONY D. Very attentive and friendly as a great friend , many greetings, in general excellent my stay, the room I love has a very nice views of the city. I RECOMMEND IT EXTENSIVELY.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay and we are happy to know that our service and property exceeded expectations. Tony will be commended for doing an excellent job and we look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour. It was truly our pleasure to be a part of this special moment and congratulations on your engagement. We appreciate having you stay with us and look forward to having you back as our guest anytime your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,"
"Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon."
"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback."
"I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
"I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!"
"Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites."
"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable."
"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great."
"This is my favorite Marriott property in Seattle. The location is hard to beat and the water views are worth the great sunsets and I love watching the seaplanes come and go. Many great food choices are in this area, with even more coming to Lake Union. Nice remodeled lobby and breakfast area. Staff is always super friendly and you have to love the extra points game they offer at check in. I'll be back soon!Hello TruckeeTroutTraveler,We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your wonderful feedback about your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. I am glad that we provided you with a positive and memorable experience and exceptional service. Hope to see you soon!Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!"
"Wonderful stay! The hotel was amazing. Modern, superb location, clean and wasn't expecting a full kitchen. The staff was wonderful!! Especially Brennan!! Very helpful! Breakfast buffet is top notch! Create your own omelet!"
"We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good. When you are ready to return just call and they will collect you from one of the designated pickup pointsI would return to this Hotel if ever back in Seattle"
"Comfortable clean pleasant spacious rooms with cooking facilities Friendly and helpful staff Superb breakfast Good location opposite the Space Needle and Monorail Best of the hotels during our three week holiday in America Highly recommendedDear Nick W,Thank you very much for reviewing the Hyatt house Seattle! We very much appreciate the 5 star review and are delighted to hear you felt we were a hotel to remember! We know you have a lot of choices when staying in Seattle and are thankful you choose us and would highly recommend us.Thank you and I hope the rest of your trip in America went just a great! Sincerely,Jonathan"
"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly.

"It is right under space needle. You can even see Space Needle from the window. After the tour of space needle, kids actually had a nap in the hotel as it is only a few steps away. It is a new Hyatt property with free breakfast."
"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!"
"Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge"
"Starting with the location - excellent. Perfect to explore the downtown area on foot, many attractions within walking distance or the free shuttle will take you.The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We loved having a small kitchen, we loved everything about the room.We were helped by Behder at the front desk who answered all out questions and made us feel very welcome.Any time we return to Seattle, there will be no other option for us than the Hyatt House."
"This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. I will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards. We appreciate the positive comments and will look forward to your future visits to Seattle.Sarah Junge"
"Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of the kitchen facilities in the room, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge"
"I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you! Dear KaylaNGerardW,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you and your enjoyed our staff and felt like home to you! We greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel. Sorry about your car issues, but I am glad that we would help with that stress. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again hopefully soon! Sincerely,Jonathan"
"This hotel is the place to be to experience downtown Seattle. The Monorail, Seattle Center, are across the street and the waterfront is walkable or by shuttle. The Light Rail from Westlake Center can take you right out to Sea-Tac. We'll be back!!!Sarah P,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge"
"Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one."
"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!"
"This was my fist trip to Seattle, and this hotel was in a great location. Pikes Market is about 1.5 miles away. Everything is in walking distance, or there is a shuttle that will take you up to a mile out. It was a great experience.Dear AlexanderpX371AN, Thank you for completing a Tripadvisor Review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. I am glad that the location was a great for you!

"I recently stayed at the Hyatt House Hotel in Seattle, it was a great place to stay. Our room was very nice and clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, and our view out of the window was of the space needle. The hotel is in a great location with a 2 minute ride on the monorail into Seattle town. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and Pike Place Market to wander around."
"Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest. Overall the Hyatt House was an excellent choice for our Seattle vacation!Cushionhead,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! I have shared your feedback with the team regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations. Please let us know when you visit next as we look forward to having you as our guest!Sarah Junge"
"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

"This Hotel was very clean and very convenient within walking distance to all attractions and to the Cruise Piers. They are located directly across the street from the Space Needle so our view from our window was spectacular. Would recommend this to anyone visiting for a few days prior to going on a CRUISE. Also close to the Monorail that will take you into the city.reneeo784,On behalf of the staff, we truly appreciate you choosing the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. Your comments about the cleanliness of the rooms and unbeatable location next to the iconic space needle and Seattle Center has the team proud to be members of the hotel. We hope you can join us again for your next trip into Seattle!Sarah Junge"
"I recently stayed at this hotel while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center. This hotel is about a mile from the convention center but the hotel has a shuttle for free. My room was very clean and welcoming. My only minor issue with the hotel is the HVAC system in the room does not allow for fan on at all time. I prefer this while sleeping.Dear Hunterhersh: Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at the Hyatt House Seattle. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the location and our free shuttle.

"We couldn't be happier with our stay at Hyatt House Seattle. The front desk was so accommodating, they had recommendations for restaurants things to do, they also helped us if we needed directions to places we also wanted to visit. There was also a shuttle that we relied on to get us around, it was great! Thank you Hyatt... More"
"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team. I am glad the our larger rooms and knowledgeable staff made your stay great. We hope to see you soon weather it be for business or pleasure! Sincerely,Jonathan"
"Very impressed with this hotel. Great location opposite the Space Needle - and the monorail ran past our windows - no noise at all!So convenient for getting quickly into the centre for all your sight seeing. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with little kitchenette facilities. Breakfast buffet was good, and there are ready meals and snacks to purchase from the front desk area if you arrive late and want to rustle up a quick bite in your room.Ideal for families travelling to Seattle this was a comfortable and well equipped base.Recommend and would return."
"I really enjoyed staying at the Hyatt House, the room was comfortable, the shower was great. The staff was very attentive and the shuttle easy to take to local spots in the area. A really comfortable place to be when you're away from home.Erika W,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge"
"We stayed here wilt our grandson and his Dalmatian dog and we had a terrific stay! Julia was joking with our grandson about how big the dog was and he thought that was great, everyday when we got back to the hotel he was looking for her to talk to about what he and the dog did, and by the end of our stay he was hugging her goodbye. Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything. Keep up the good worklwill789,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you, your grandson and his Dalmatian dog created wonderful memories throughout Seattle and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. I will pass on your kind words to the staff, they will all be bursting with excitement knowing they made a difference. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences. Please let us know when you plan on returning to Seattle as we would love to you welcome you as our guest again!Sarah Junge"
"We stayed 4 nights and had a corner room. Its across the street from City Center and the Space Needle. Hop on the Monorail and you are downtown, a short walk to Pikes Place Market. Its hard to find nice rooms in Seattle for under 200 a night, which is what we paid, including taxes and parking. Oh, and did I say breakfast was included.Dear Gary S,Thank you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I am glad to hear that you found our location to be great and our hotel to be a great value! I greatly appreciate your 5 star review it will be celebrated with the hotel.

"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge"
"What a killer hotel! I got in really early and there was no room available when I arrived, but the front desk took quick care in making sure I had somewhere to change and get ready for work in time! Such great service! Rooms were very clean and well maintained with great views of the city! I will be back, thanks!Hi Michael, Thanks for the great review!! Glad we were able to help get you to work on time. Your coming back is what matters most to us!See you then!Evan"
"Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!"
"Our guests had a fabulous weekend. Rooms were beautiful. Staff were amazing and so accommodating. Comfortable lobby with pool table and games was a great meeting space. We had a light breakfast for our guests the morning after the wedding in the lobby and it worked out great. Would highly recommend Aloft Downtown as the hotel for your wedding guests!Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!! It was a thrill to serve the entire wedding party. It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space. Sorry about the rain, it would have been really cool for your family and friends to enjoy the Backyard. Hope the bride and groom enjoy the honeymoon! We'd love to have all of you back for the anniversaries! Evan"
"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well. I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
"Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again."
"We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan"
"Very good situation in the center of Philadelphia, the beds are perfects. Our only night here was just great, the night are completly dark, which is important for us, and very quiet. John was very helpfull. Thank youCD, We appreciate the great review! Glad you got to take advantage of the blackout shades and quiet space for a restful night sleep. Hope to have you back for more than one night! Evan"
"We needed a room for one day after surgery and having to return to the hospital the next day so Aloft was closest! To our pleasant surprise the staff was above and beyond accommodating from Tevin in Valet department to Misia and Tatyanna front desk! Thank you so much! Linda, Hopefully the surgery was as successful as the as your visit to our hotel. We do have the BEST STAFF and are grateful for their efforts. Tatyanna, Misha and Tevin will be cheered and celebrated for your shout out. Thank you for recognizing their efforts. Heal fast, then come back and have some fun!Evan"
"When we arrived, our 2-queen room had not been prepared. The staff gave us 2 1-king rooms for the first night, then moved us to a 2-queen room for the second night. They were very helpful in scheduling our move and handling our bags. Well done!Hi 429,Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!!!! Sorry we didn't have the two bed room available upon your arrival, that sometimes happens in our biz. Glad we were able to overcome and create a great experience for you. Hope to get back soon, there's still plenty of summer left to play! Evan"
"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan"
"Awesome hotel in an awesome location in an awesome city. The staff went above and beyond. The style of the hotel was great. We had an awesome view of city hall. Perfect central location to do anything in Phily.Perryjo9,Thank you so much! Awesome is certainly the word I would also choose to describe our team, they are the best in the city, and we are truly fortunate to have them all. I am so glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself so much, and I hope that we have the chance to see you again soon!Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
"It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!! Bedside in two locations, on the desk, under the W XYZ Bar and throughout the lobby areas. We want to be sure your connected and in touch!Can't wait to have you back! Thank you for your business!Evan"
"Everything was great, staff is wonderful, Misha at front desk was so helpful! So glad I picked this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. Loved our room-was a corner room with 2 queens, very comfortable. Favorite part was the lobby, just a great place to hang out, nice bar, fun games, music at night, really cool area. We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon! Evan (Misha's biggest fan)"
"My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan"
"What a cool hotel! Super friendly, helpful and thorough check in and up to a super cool room!The views are amazing, the location couldnt be better! Youre ten-fifteen minutes from all the sights! Check out the view from my room!!Awesome! My favourite hotel by a long way.Dont stay somewhere average, dont stay somewhere boring stay here and feel the coolness permeate to you!Good work guys! Good workMartin, Have to say, this is my favourite review of the day!! Your don't stay somewhere average... line is classic. Perhaps you should be our new pitchman! Thanks for the recognition of the good work, a lot goes into getting this right from the brand, to the design and of course the most important part the staff! Thanks for staying here and hope to have you back soon! Evan"
"The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West."
"Great place to hang and rest after doing the Key West thing. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is gorgeous! Attention to detail from the lobby to the room's bathroom. The pool area is an oasis to cool your body and enhance your soul. We plan to make this our place to stay whenever we're in Key West and can't wait to check out the one in New Orleans. GreatHotelsThank You for taking time out to give our property such a wonderful review. We are so tickle our property has made such an impression. We also appreciate any loyalty or interest you may have in our sister property which like Key West is an amazing property. Please contact us to assist in any future reservations or information you may need."

We greatly appreciate all the kind words you have for our property and staff. Please keep us in mind should you be traveling to Key West in the near or not so near future. Once again Thank You."
"Paul the other bartenders are always so attentive. I enjoy going in and relaxing. I tell everyone I know to stop in and see how nice the Saint is. The food is good and the drink menu is fun... I tell all my friends to stop in 417 to 714 happy hour.It's a great happy hour to try all that we have to offer in food and drinks. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to seeing you soon!"
"What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad and we are ecstatic that you had a great stay with us. Please come back and see us again, we would be delighted to have you!"
"This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere. We are so glad that you found it conveniently located to everything! We hope you will come visit us again. Thank you again for your review."
"This perfect hotel is in the perfect location. The photos here don't do it justice. If you like trendy boutique hotels, then this is the perfect place for you to stay in Key West. We loved everything about our stay. The room and property were well kept and clean, the breakfast was plentiful and met our needs, and the staff were all very friendly. I would recommend this hotel for couples or a getaway with friends.Thank You, and a special thanks from the staff of The Saint Hotel Key West. We are extremely thankful for your recommendations and your excellent praise of the property. We hope we have the opportunity to accommodate you on your next trip to Key West."
"The Wait staff in Bar not so good and not friendly. The rest of was stay was very good. Clean rooms great location for the Duval Crawl. I will be back next time I'm in the area. Being I am a fan of Key west I wanted to try something differentThank you for your feedback and I will share this with the Food Beverage manager so that this is a single occurance. We hope to have another chance to serve you on your next trip to Key West!"
"We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you were able to indulge in one of our delicious drinks. We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to each staff member you mentioned. Please come back and see us!"
"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!"
"The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review."
"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future."
"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon."
"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!"
"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West."
"Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay."
"During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming."
"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!"
"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action."
"Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed."
"With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed"
"Didn't do a review for our March/April visit but our stay for July/August was just as good and as always its like coming home to Family, our Maid Ada is an absolute star and looked after us to perfection, all the girls in the coffee shop are great and even have our order prepared if they seen us walking up for our morning coffee, special mention for Whitney who was good enough to take us shopping one day, Suncoast you have lots of real stars working here that make our trips great and even harder to leave on our long journey home,see you all in March 2018."
"The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!"
"My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner. This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater."
"We stayed 4 nights and for the price it met far behine my expectation. Every thing is there for you right in this hotel. I love this hotel and I will be booking there again on my next trip to Las Vegas. They rooms are big and very clean. This hotel is great for a family trip,so much to see and do."
"I love the small size overall. This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference. The pool is perfect, with full sun AND cabanas. There is a wide choice of restaurants and all are well served. We saw a movie while there and had a nice choice of current movies."
"My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently. The casino offers tons of entertainment, has bowling, several movies theatres, great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses. The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas. Needless to say, we love it. We will absolutely be back.Thank you for visiting us! We look forward to you visiting again."
"Truly a magnificent hotel. Beautiful, spacious rooms massive bathrooms. Not anywhere near the strip, but if you are a hiker/climber, this a great location to access the Red Rock Canyon/Spring Mountain Recreation areas. Would go back in a heartbeat. Stay away from the tight slots though."
"Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives. The room was clean and spacious (we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute). Views of the strip or mountains, or both if you get a suite. Well located for west Vegas activities. Good restaurants at the hotel and nearby. Will definitely stay there again."
"With several shows going on everything near the strip that is reasonable was sold out.I stay at Coast Casino hotels most often when in Vegas so decided to try the suncoast. Yes it is a bit off the beaten path but you're back in the action in 15 minutes... That said the rooms are big as are the bathrooms the staff is super friendly and the restaurants are great...If you like Golf...you're right next door to Angel Park Golf club...didn't have the time to try it out but the reviews are good."
"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!"
"Had a Comp Night at the Suncoast, 2 Queen Sized Bed room. Room seems to be larger than most vegas hotel rooms. Large Bathroom, Clean Quiet... Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel, but also offers a hot tub. Casino a bit smoky, perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher."
"I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!"
"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!"
"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast."
"We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again."
"I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!"
"Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to."
"This was worst hotel. Te service no good. They need training customer service."
"Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,. Again,Please DO NOT STAY HERE"
"For us it was a fabulous location getting on rail to Cubs game and shopping for what we wanted to do. It's was easily accessible for dining as well Everyone in the hotel was very kind and were able to help with any questions we had Hello Pam D,We are glad our location made your visit to Chicago ideal for your Cubs game! Our service level is something we pride ourselves on and glad it showed during your trip. We hope to see you next time in town!"
"The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi. Plenty of shopping and dining in the area. There is a Irish Pub just around the corner from the hotel. Across the street is a running / walking path along the river. Great for people watching. Would stay here again."
"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again."
"The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions. It is right by the river which is a nice view. The room was really modern and clean. There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it.Thank you, Alex F, for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed the accommodations, prime location and friendly staff. We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit!"
"Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive."
"The room was nice although a little bit small. The employees were very nice. It was really nice to have snacks, sodas, coffee and water at all times. The price was really good realeated to the services. I definitely recommend it.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation. I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!"
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again."
"We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street."
"I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!"
"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 .

"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here."
"Best price hotel in the city! Great location, walking distances to everything! Staff was professional and friendly. If you needed something, they were on it! Our room was very modern, clean, and beds were comfortable. Very quiet for when you are ready to rest! Classy place."
"The staff, room, experience in Chicago for being the first time was great. I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends. research your plans before anything you do. Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites."
"Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff. The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests. The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center. The hotel's location is excellent and right on the river. I would stay there again without hesitation.Hello nchat1,Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience. We work hard to ensure our guests are happy and it clearly paid off! We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago!"
"We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!"
"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!"
"Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town."
"Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!"
"Loved this hotel for its service, amenities, location (walking distance to everything), free wine hour, laundry room, the rooms were very clean, perfect size, comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here on my next visit."
"The rooms are small but well thought out. They are very cosy and comfortable. It is across from the Trump Towers and the river where you can get on a boat and go for a little cruise, the Big Bus company stops directly across the street from the hotel"
"The room was small quite clean the staff very helpful. I would stay here again as the location is wonderful, the price is reasonable and room adequate. I don't spend much time in a hotel room so the lack of space was not a problem."
"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
"The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff! They make you feel extremely welcome and that they cannot do enough to accommodate you. I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk, who was cheerful and obliging, and a great ambassador for the hotel. The location is perfect, and the rooms both comfortable and private. Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers. I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay. Pedro is great and a big part of our team and I will be sure he sees your kind words. Thank you for taking the time to recognize him as you have.Please come see us again!"
"Contemporary rooms in a great old building. Friendly staff, wonderful Italian restaurant right next door. Within short walking distance to so many great Chicago attractions. My new favorite hotel in Chicago!"
"We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave."
"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience. We are thrilled to know you found everything to your liking. We really enjoy passing on comments such as yours to our colleagues and thanking them for their great guest service.We sincerely appreciate your recommendation!"
"Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that."
"The rooms are smallish but up-to-date. Very clean and sleek, two of us did not feel cramped. The hotel provides unlimited cold, filtered water and bottles for you to put the water in. They also have coffee, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. The views from the river view rooms are spectacular (we were on the 7th floor). Location is central. The staff is friendly and accomodating. The restaurant has a great mushroom with mozarella de bufalo and risotto appetizer. You really cannot ask for a better hotel!"
"I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table."
"We like to have more than just a bedroom. This is a nice timeshare apartment. Near Union Square and Nob Hill."
"Such a pleasant play to stay and enjoy SF"
"Excellent location and very comfortable accommodations. Trader Joes was only a couple of blocks away, so it was easy to pick up a few staples for breakfast. This unit had a very efficient use of space for a family of four (two young adults). Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Definitely recommend this place, but we never answered the phone because we read the warnings about time share pestering."
"We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom. While there were only two of us, we certainly enjoyed the extra space. This would be a great place for a small family! And it's only a couple blocks to Union Square.Good Morning JudyZ24,We appreciate the time to comment on your stay with us. I was happy to read that you enjoyed your room and the amenities that we provided during your stay. We hope that you will come back to stay with us again soon.Regards,Matthew JonesGeneral ManagerWyndham Canterbury at San Francisco"
"This hotel or what they call themselves motel poses an excellent location in the downtown , with fair value you will not find competitive hotel has the same or near value , free parking is a big bonus, Staff are very polite and treat you as family member"
"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!"
"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel."
"Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns. Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment, and as such, we apologize. Our staff aims to provide the highest level of hospitality to our guests through our customer service, but with your experience, we have fallen short and would like to apologize for the service issues you describe. We invite you to contact our Guest Relations at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your visit to help us provide a better guest experience in the future."
"Spent the night here with spouse. Check-in was friendly and fast. Free parking if you have a car and free airport shuttle if you fly. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Very comfortable beds with nice linens. Bath amenities in shower are in dispensers. Soap bars at sink. Great shower head! Single-serve coffee maker, hair dryer, free long distance calls... More"
"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene."
"Great hotel and grounds and easy drive from the airport. One of the nicest hotel chains I have stayed in for this price range."
"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe."
"We stayed for one night while passing through on the way to Florida. What a great experience! The staff was so friendly and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable, beautiful and clean. My daughter loved the pool, and it was kept up nicely. Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus. All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces, I'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created."
"As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance."
"we have stayed at the drury near the Atlanta airport for the last 3 years. great accomodations, friendly staff, affordable, clean, ample parking, etc. very family friendly. will continue to stay here when I have to go to Atlanta"
"The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance."
"The staff are not only well trained, they are well hired. In other words, the people the employees are a match for the Drury brand, as their personalities are what I want to see in a hotel. They are friendly, but not cold and 'all business.' These folks have a big job, as for many they offer the first impression... More"
"First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!"
"Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp."
"We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes."
"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury."
"My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica. We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport. We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic. The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable. The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport. We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn."
"I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for five nights at the end of my six week honeymoon in North and South America. I know you get what you pay for however, this hotel was a complete dissapointment and a sour end to an amazing holiday. It's on the border of the tenderloin district which is known as the... More"
"The hotel was close to my family who we were visiting. The staff were outstanding."
"Since I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway, and being able to shop at the mall right next door, and eat at an IHOP, also right next door in that mall... Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand.Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning, because the bed was firm, like my own bed at home, so I was very comfortable."
"The staff was very professional and Helpful I loved the restaurant....and the free shuttle service....And we did tip the driver........a wonderful place to stay for early morning flights out of Midway."
"Love the stay..got off to a rocky start. .doing renovations on 2nd floor. Major problem...but told staff and the accommodations were fantastic...5th floor suite stay from there... I also stayed an extra 2 days just bc of the staff...would recommend this suite to anyone"
"Very nice"
"It was a short trip, but made very comfortable by the clean room, free breakfast, large breakfast room and the free shuttle to Midway Airport."
"Check-in was a breeze, room was great and we loved the pillows. Close to the aiport and a good rate per night."
"WiFi was not any good. Everything else, was enough for the price."
"It was very easy to reach the airport with free transportation and a on site restaurant to get a quick meal early in the am.i"
"Bad: I didn't like the fact that we only stayed for one night. Good: Fabulous boutique hotel. Great location. Lovely complimentary breakfast. Will return."
"Good: James an Mike were great.....they gave me everything I needed an made me feel very comfortable. The lady that served breakfast was very nice also .Very clean....I will stay there again......5 min. walk to the beach w/ a beautiful park on the way."
"Bad: We had a bit of a problem with our keycards but the staff was so friendly and helpful. Good: The staff was very pleasant. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower was AMAZING! Great location also. Walking distance to Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue. Would definitely stay here again!"
"The staff was so kind, everywhere was so clean, and good location"
"Bad: Nothing bad. . Good: Great location. Within walking distance to everything we wanted to see."
"The hotel was a pleasant surprise. Perfectly located in the French Quarter and 1 block from Bourbon Street. I stayed in a petite room - but was impressed by the updated and clean rooms/bathrooms. Upon arrival, the staff were warm and welcoming - even carried my luggage up the 2 flights of stairs to the room. Air conditioned rooms, free... More"
"As a traveling superintendent ,I was there for two weeks and had a great stay, the breakfast was a nice bonus , liked that they had a to go breakfast available , and the coffee was good, referred a business associate to stay there he will be staying for 60+ days also"
"The staff and the level of service at this Hampton Inn were amazing. They are very polite and helpful. Whenever I'm in the Alexandria, VA area, I always choose this Hampton Inn because of the service they provide and the environment while in their facility. The rooms are clean and comfortable while you are away from home."
"A good room at a good rate. Ive seen better breakfast, but I have seen a lot worse. There is plenty of parking, security seems good and the bed was comfortable."
"This is the sixth time we've stayed here. Great rooms, excellent service, and a sweet breakfast with a make omelettes to order chef! Close to USAFA and lots of good stuff. Colleen is the bomb, and will give you wonderful personal service!"
"I stayed here for one night for business. I am a Marriott person myself, but was pleasantly surprised! I would compare it to a Marriott Courtyard! The room was very nice and clean and the staff was friendly. The hot breakfast included eggs, sausage, biscuits, hot cinnamon rolls, pancakes, bagels, toast, etc. and was wonderful! I would highly recommend it!"
"Stay at this hotel about 4 times per year. Always friendly staff, decent breakfast, comfortable mattress and clean. Easy to find right past Bandera exit off 1604 NW, San Antonio, Tx. Never have any problems. Very reliable quality of service."
"Very Nice Hotel very clean. was very close to event. Had good breakfast served in the morning. Was close to shopping for the wife. Lots of restaurant close to Hotel. Easy excess to Highway. Was impressed with the Beds."

"Stopped here after my son's Doctor visit at Geisinger. Very relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere, excellent service and the food was exceptional."
"I went to the Pine Barn for a baby shower and it was beautifully decorated, quiet and wonderful service. So wonderful to have a historic Inn in our area!"
"We got a free upgrade to a room with a jacuzi. It was right in the middle of the bed room... too funny! The beds where fine, the staff was great but the view from the top deck during breakfast....breathtaking!!!! I would go back in a heartbeat!"
"When I arrived at the hotel the service I received from Shannon at the front desk was absolutely amazing.. She helped me take my luggage upstairs without any hesitation. She later called my room to make sure everything was acceptable to my needs and then she was back in the morning to help me all over again.. The kind of... More"

"The Dodge City Hampton Inn and Suites was a pleasant and comfortable stay. My only complaint is that they switched out the biscuit and gravy for French toast sticks. but the food was very good and the rooms were clean as well as roomy."
"The staff are very friendly and willing to assist you with whatever need you may have. The rooms are modern and reasonably priced, the Internet is fast and free for Hilton Honors members. There is a casino right next door, I don't really gamble so I can't review it."
"Very helpful and friendly staff, always taking care of my needs. Special thank you to Analy and Omar Andrade for responding to my requests. Lots of warm smiles and willingness to make you feel at home."
"My overall experience at Hampton Inn in Dodge City, ks was excellent. The staff is very professional and courteous. The accommodations were excellent. The atmosphere is pleasant for all ages. The room was spacious and great for relaxing. Breakfast was delicious."
"Sold our house and couldn't move into new house for several weeks. Spent a week at this hotel. The staff was VERY accommodating. Marilynn, who serves the free breakfast, was very nice and welcoming. Housekeeping did a great job as well."
"We had a 3-day business planning retreat here. We wanted an environment different from the average, away from the day-to-day, where we could unplug, unwind and connect fully with what is important. This was perfect. We rented the entire bed and breakfast. Way better than a typical hotel. Started each day with a brisk long walk in the fresh air... More"
"Had a blast at Arizona Mountain Inn. Cabins are really neat, fully equipped, and the staff goes above and beyond expectations to make you feel comfortable. If you're looking for that log-cabin experience, this is the place for you. Winter skiing, hiking, fishing, hunting, golfing.... all nearby. Super vacation!"
"We stayed for 6 nights in Cabin 5. It was more spacious than it looked on the website photographs. It did not feel crowded or squished. And the reading room was cute--nice place to sit quietly. The cabins are neither fancy nor shabby, just good old-fashioned cabins with functional kitchenettes or full kitchens that are equipped with most of what... More"

"We stayed here as a weekend get away. First time staying at this location. We definitely would stay again. I had wonderful treatments at the spa across the street. Loved the pool area and hot tub and location of ice machine. The fresh fruit water everyday in the lobby was great."
"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location. I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them. He is a tremendous asset to our team. We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport. Again, thank you for your feedback."
"The stay was highly satisfactory. We were very impressed with Dan, who was managing the desk. There seemed to be some confusion about the category of room (we were allotted a room meant for handicapped person) but Dan straightened it out within a minute. He was also helpful with neighborhood information. Will stay there if we visit Newport again."
"The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. They had coffee and tea available in the lobby throughout the day and the night. The included breakfast was different each day and it was quite tasty for a hotel breakfast. I loved the fresh fruit that was in the lobby at all times and the cookies in the evening. Our room was very clean. The only thing I would recommend is that they scrub the hot tub. Although the hotel is not in Newport, it is a straight drive right into the town."
"I've come to expect an excellent level of comfort at Hilton brand hotels, and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint! Spotlessly clean, with friendly staff, free breakfast and comfortable rooms. This hotel also has a shuttle service to downtown Newport, which is very convenient, since parking is at a premium during the summer season."
"Stayed here while visiting our Southwestern College student the inn is less than 5 mins. from the college very near downtown Winfield. Inn has a retro feel to it as you pull in it is one story tall and you park your vehicle right outside the door of your room. Owner showed us three rooms and we would have... More"
"I decided to stay here to have a quick and easy drive to the airport in the morning. This property is brand new and fabulous. My jaw literally dropped when I went to check out the exercise room! Easy drive to chain restaurants and Target. I wish all properties were like this one!"

"I can't say one negative thing about this hotel. When I arrived the bellhops greeted me and showed me inside where I was greeted by a friendly employee and checked in in less than 5 minutes. My room was 437 and was very quiet and had a nice view over the front entry area and up the road - I... More"
"I really like this hotel -- friendly, inviting staff upon arrival, vibrant lobby and bar, and large clean rooms.It is close to the airport and within walking distance of many fine dining opportunities.

"Loved the stay staff was friendly pool was nice coffee was great! The room was clean and bed extemely comfortable.

"Found The Press Hotel when searching Trip Advisor and we were thankful. What a nice surprise finding this architectural gem. We were looking for a property centrally located with amenities. Lucky us, The Press was the solution. The one night weekend rate was way under the rack rate - considerably. The service was top notch from the valet, bellman, and... More"
"Hip, but not too hip. Staff super friendly and knowledgeable. Absolutely perfect location for walking around Portland. Rooms nicely appointed, if a touch small (few drawers for clothes) big bathrooms. Restaurant solid and bar good too. Really excellent little boutique-feeling hotel."
"This was our second stay at ARia. We booked during a promotion which was going to give us an upgrade to a strip view. Unfortunately, we were only able to see a little part of the strip, but who could argue, a strip view it was. Check in/ check out was fast, in spite of a moderate long lineup. We... More"
"4th stay at Aria. It never disappoints. Food, cleanliness, hotel staff, atmosphere cannot be beat. My next stay in Vegas will be my 5th stay at Aria. Try the Bardot Restaurant for wonderful French cuisine."
"Me and my 3 girlfriends went here. Bouncer was extremely rude to my friend who had sunglasses on and accused her of being drunk and barely let her into the club even though she didn't have anything to drink the whole day. Eventually we got in and paid cover but the pool closed 2 hours early. We still had an... More"
"We came for a weekend getaway with friends and our third time at the Aria. We have tried other properties and just feel the Aria is the best-- perfect location, incredible restaurants, wonderful pool and fitness areas... And don't forget the smell when you enter the lobby-- I'm pretty convinced that's what Heaven smells like!"
"I rarely if ever give a five star and I am not a fan of Vegas. This place was exquisite and the perfect place for a romantic getaway. You never have to leave the hotel area. Forgetting Las Vegas for a moment if you can avoid losing your retirement pay at the casino and just gamble for entertainment then I... More"

"We stayed for 3 nights and had a room with a great view of the strip on the 25th floor. Rooms are lovely with a tablet to control all functions. Everything is pricey here but that's to be expected from the strip!"
"This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds! Stunning service with kindness, support and upgrades when any question came up. Ex. When I called the operator to find out the opening time of Jean Phillipe, she said, they opened 30 minutes ago, Mr. G---, they are waiting for you...--absolute magic."
"Staff were exceptionally friendly throughout the resort and the room was beautiful and very comfortable - felt like I was in a 5 star resort. Pools were gorgeous but found the restaurants were a little overpriced for me."

"We pick the Aria for laid back location and the modern feel. The staff seems to care. Yes we lost all our gambling funds but the atmosphere and vibe was worth it. It is a special place..great for the modern crowd but not extremely trendy..."
"Stayed at the Aria on a business trip. Originally I was a little concerned about the distance from the hotel to the strip, but its not near as bad as it looks on a map. The casino is great and the location in respect to other hotels is perfect. I did not have a change to try out the restaurants... More"
"Being empty nest'rs, we tend to look for more elegant adult atmospheres and of course want our money to go a long way... I am very particular in my lodging choices and the Aria did not disappoint!

Our room was great with a strip view - spacious, super comfy bed, lovely shower/bath area and lots of wardrobe/drawer space. Our only room complaint was that... More"
"We had high hopes for the Aria - during our Christmas mini-getaway we chose it over several competing hotels due to its promise of a newer hotel with great service and amenities. We arrived at around 11:30 pm and were surprised to find a long winding line at the check in area. The line moved at an excruciatingly slow pace... More"
"Beautiful hotel! Room was perfect, with several bonuses such as press-button controls of the blinds, lights, and TV. I felt safe in my room Aria associates were stationed outside of elevators to make sure only guests were permitted on the hotel area. In addition to the rooms, the conference center was comfortable and attractive. Food offered (and the staff that... More"
"I've been to Vegas about 8 times and I've stayed in a variety of hotels, from the Venetian, Paris, Bellagio, Bally's, Wynn, Caesar's Palace, Hilton, etc. I'd say that Aria is the most modern and sleek hotel. Maybe because it's one of the newer ones, but I will admit I like their ambiance. The location is great, it's right by... More"
"This was our second visit to the Aria we were allocated a Tower Suite on the 22nd floor. This suite was fabulous with lounge, entry hall separate bedroom and massive bathroom, the comfort and attention to detail superb and we found ourselves relaxing in here and hiding from the heat outside. You are also allocated the Tower Lounge with separate... More"
"We stayed at the Aria for a couple of nights in July 2016 as a starting point for our family road trip and found it to be an excellent hotel. It has been a long time since we had been to Las Vegas and quite a lot has changed in that time. It used to be a place where accommodation... More"
"This is our second time to stay at the Aria. My husband and I love this hotel. Not a lot of horrible traffic through the resort like you have at some of the other hotels.

"I would definitely stay at the Aria again. The Aria needs to hire more more Check-in staff from 5PM - 7PM. We had to wait at least 15 minutes to check-in, I felt like I was at an Airport Ticket Counter"
"I recently attended a conference held at ARIA Las Vegas. This was my first trip to Vegas but it definitely won't be my last! The conference accommodations were fantastic (room temperature was a bit too cold at times) however, I fell in love with this hotel. The ARIA buffet has so many international food options, I felt I was dining... More"
"Beautiful hotel. For 109 you expect an average hotel but this is awesome. Automatic blinds, lights, huge bathroom. Nice standing shower with jacuzzi. Great cleaning staff, front desk, room service. Grilled chicken sandwich was the best ever. Mini bar prices are not too bad, fiji water was more expensive than liquor. 9.50 for a bottle of fiji water but 6... More"
"The pictures do this place no justice. IT IS AWESOME! BEAUTIFUL!!! The entire property is immaculate.

"6 friends on a very short break completely blown over by The Aria. Everything very efficient from start to finish during our stay.Location perfect. Rooms huge and spotless with fantastic views-only downside was the pillows-too soft for my liking. We asked for rooms near to each other and this request was easily met. The lobby areas very clean, casino not... More"
"Aria is excelent on al counts for a Las Vegas stay. It has excellent facilities and service is great in all areas of the hotel. Considering its size, it does provide high quality in all respects. I have had excellent experiences at this hotel and our last stay was no exception."
"The room was great we had a corner suite with a pano view. The staff were great and the restaurants were amazing. Checking in at the tower suites was fantastic. No line ups and very friendly staff. Overall the Hotel is fantastic. Very easy to navigate throughout the hotel as many casinos are very confusing. Good central location as well."
"Traveled there a few weeks back for my 35th birthday and my stay at Aria was nothing short of AMAZING! Will definitely stay there again. From the staff to the food at the buffet and the cafe to the night life. One of the best stays I've had in Vegas!!"
"I travel at least once per year and as far as all the hotels I've been to, this has been the best by far. The food, service and room was probably the best that I've experienced. I've been to Vegas 4 times now and used to stay at Cesar's but this place doesn't compare with anything else in Vegas. Between... More"
"We had a wonderful stay at the Aria. Breakfast buffet had everything you could want. Had a need for maintenance, they were quick and professional. Pool time was fantastic. Check-in was a bit rough, apparently if you use express check-in, you can bill purchases to your room. Overall, great trip!!"
"We visited the Aria for our 10th wedding anniversary on 22nd September. Proper wow factor on walking in, no need to queue as we had checked in using the app. Rooms were beautiful with everything powered by the tablet - watch out for the mini bar though as the prices are pretty hefty. We ate in Caf Aria - amazing... More"
"FIrst trip to Vegas and we had heard everyone rave about this place, so we decided to book it. First impression....WOW...absolutely gorgeous.

We booked through... More"
"Room was great. Comfortable, ultra modern contemporary, very clean and high tech. Bath was my favorite w/phone. Loved the electronic controls for lights, curtain, television, etc. All controls at you fingertips. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Very friendly staff. Checked in early without a fee. Not all check-in stations open, but have an electronic check-in (and check-out) option. Tram was... More"
"Booked a combo deal through Southwest, excellent value, very nice hotel. Clean rooms, quite, polite staff. Little smokey in the casino but you can get away from that. The gym was nice and they have a excellent restaurant Javier's a must go to place. Rooms are also fully automated, very cool."
"We stayed at the Aria 3/23/16 - 3/27/16. Our room was 22118 of the tower suites, the view of the strip was spectacular! The room itself was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bed, let's just say, I wish I could have taken it home with me. Amazing comfort. The staff at the Aria was amazing.... More"

We loved the high end Mexican restaurant and the breakfast buffet...which offered a vast choice! I'm sure this is modern high end Vegas at its very best."
"A friend and I came to Vegas for her birthday for a few days. We loved our stay here. The hotel and casino is very clean, staff is helpful, and the rooms feel like luxury. We liked that everything in the room can be controlled by an iPad, and you can shut everything off at once at bed time. Also,... More"
"I was in Las Vegas on a quick business trip recently and really didn't have any idea where to stay. Aria looked new and fresh and the package deal with airfare was pretty compelling. The room was large with a stunning view and huge windows. The room was clean enough to eat off the floor (although I chose not to).... More"
"From the second you Valet your car, to check-in, service is phenomenal. Highly recommend this luxury hotel. We stay here most times when visiting Las Vegas. Never have we been disappointed. We stayed in a corner suite facing the strip with 3 TVs and 2 bathrooms...can't get much nicer then that!"
"For the money paid, this is a hotel that offers great value. Having stayed at Delano, Venetian, Caesars and Planet Hollywood (not on the same level!), this has the best bang for the buck. Security was good and kept outside riff-raff out. Food options were from high end to easy to buy. Prices were consistent with all other resorts, and... More"
"The Aria has it all!! It's large, bright, clean, has an amazing swimming pool area plus a gorgeous spa!! We had an amazing Thai meal which was lovely. The hotel is close by to everything and has a tram to other hotels too. When we come back to Vegas we will stay here again!!"

"Amazing views of the strip, awesome rooms and exceptional service. Spa is worth the money, spent the day after massages enjoying sauna and pools. Would recommend Aria to couple who want a modern resort with out the noise, the restaurants have craft beers from all over the world. The seafood was fresh off the boat. Looking forward to our next... More"
"This was my third time at Aria Resort and it didn't disappoint.

"Stayed four nights with hubby for a work conference. I didn't find the convention area to be as much of a trek as in other Vegas hotels. Rooms were spacious, upgraded for 30/night to get a strip view on the 31st floor. We appreciated the security posted near the guest elevators. Dealers were friendly in the casino and staff at...

"My husband took me to Las Vegas for my 30th birthday. We planned a trip through Expedia and bundled Aria into our package.

Highlights from the trip were the pool (a host easily found us front row chairs during... More"
"We just loved the Aria, everything from the Tower Suites check in to the music selection playing throughout the resort was just amazing. Very clean and spacious rooms weather a suite or just standard deluxe room. A little on the pricy side but in my opinion worth it,"
"The in room controls and excellent dining are only the tip of the iceberg for this fantastic hotel! The staff throughout, and in the spa, were superb and seemed to genuinely enjoy their job. The shower in my room was heavenly and everything was spotless. If you want to sleep on a cloud while in Vegas, ARIA is THE place... More"
"Ha! I've always wanted to use that song title for a review. ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so. Now, there were only two issues with my ARIA stay. Check in and the numbering system in the hallways. The hotel receptionist had a hard time divvying up our check in, understanding that several nights were to be paid... More"

"Beautiful hotel! The corner suite is very tech savy and modern! I like the separate living space and bedroom. I also love how everything in the room can be controlled by one device! The monorail also stops here which is a plus! Overall, it can be pricey, but it's worth it!"
"I have spent the last two birthdays at this hotel. It is the BOMB! Everything you want in a 5 star resort. I have so much fun. I visit the cafe for breakfast.

"Aria was an outstanding resort. Very nice accommodations. Great location. Easy access to parking. Wifi works great. Bedding very comfortable. Only complaint was no access to use of a mini refrigerator and onsite dining very expensive. Many other dining options close."

"worst place iv ever stayed!! ever, wouldn't stay here again. I do NOT recommend this hotel to anyone, on check in they explained to us we need to leave a holding fee of which will be refunded on check out if we were not to use anything (of which we didn't).

"The Aria is a beautiful hotel and clearly justifies its 5 star rating, from the deep lush comfy mattress of the beds to the in room tech which is brilliant. The housekeeping is also exceptional, so why is this hotel in my opinion not 100 perfect. I like to wake and rise with a coffee, I would of liked a... More"
"The hotel is one of the newer ones on the strip. Location is good. It is in between Bellagio and Monte Carlo, so we can take the free tram that runs between those 2 hotels. The hotel is big and it is a trendy one. Room is in good size. The mattress is abit too soft. There is a coffee... More"
"This hotel was amazing and I couldn't stay anywhere else now! I spent a lot of time researching the hotels for my first trip to Las Vegas.

"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the ARIA. The service, the room and the conference area were great. The room was spacious and very comfortable. I really like that everything was controlled by the tablet in the room. I will stay at the ARIA again when visiting Las Vegas."
"Got married last year at the Aria Chapel and stayed in the hotel for 10 days. We had a great time with our family and friends. Brittany from the wedding staff was very helpfull and nice. The hotel is brand new and very clean, everything is modern. Besides the casino, it have a large entertainment structure, filled up with shows,... More"
"Our family stayed at the Aria resort and casino for the first time and it was very nice. We had a corner suite in the tower, which provides access to a special room for checking in. The same room also provide free coffee, soda, water, snacks, and concierge services. There is a security person that checks everyone's room key to... More"
"Always a great stay at the ARIA, love the rooms and dining options. Tables get a little high on weekends but that happens. Great location and shopping nearby (high end,shopping) Highly recommend Todd English PUB for drinking and Serrano for eating"
"The property is great, and the poker room is the best in Vegas. I've rated the Aria as excellent overall. Since no place is perfect, these comments will address only the imperfections. First, the poker tournament area is in the casino area rather than the poker room proper. It seems to be between two discordant sources of music and in... More"
"This is a case of another Vegas hotel that thinks that just because this is Vegas it can treat its patrons like cattle. When you drive up to the hotel there is a sign to self parking. No sign for valet, just self parking. So you follow the sign to find yourself in a gigantic and full parking lot with... More"
"IF YOU BOOK THERE BE PREPAIRED! YOU NEED AN EXTRA 150 A DAY. In addition to the 35 Resort Fee. And to top it off my room isn't ready. Staying here is like having a pretty girl with an ugly attitude. It only looks good on the outside. The management is terrible"
"I had a fabulous stay. We stayed in the Tower Suite and it was fabulous. I would stay again. The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a microwave. I love the bathroom and the view was on the strip so it made it beautiful."
"After several trips to Vegas each year for the last several years The Aria remains one of my favorites. Classy place with great features. Very centrally located so you can get to many shows and other casinos."
"I was skeptical about this hotel after experiencing Area coffee on the lobby level of this hotel, but have to say I am positively surprised. The room is contemporary designed, large enough and really well maintained. everybody who likes a nice style and high quality would be happy to stay here. Yes, I would expect complimentary water in room as... More"
"Again was there for work. The rooms are ultra sleek and modern, electronic shades and curtains, full A/V system. What is great is the large bathroom with both a tub and shower and dual sinks. The WiFi in the room worked well. The mobile checkin was screwed up and it was a 50/50 for the people in line when I... More"
"excellent service very courteous staff , concierge excellent service ,bell boy very clean rooms the buffet is widely with many different stations of choices and good food the casino is very well located and winning is favorable"
"Here's a few observations. We had an early flight in, and we were able to enjoy the pool by getting 'pre' checked in, and texted us when the room was ready. Very nice. Room was fantastic: stand-up shower, tablet that controls lights, drapes, and television. Pool was super, and had adequate seating in shade and sun. Pool drinks: good, but... More"
"If you love luxury, impeccably clean rooms, stunning art, and eclectic eateries, than this place is for you. The first time I went to Aria was related to an unfortunately loud guest staying next door to me at another MGM hotel, and I can tell you that the move was the best decision I ever made, because I got to... More"
"Second time staying here, staff are always friendly at check in no free upgrade this year! They have started using a mobile check in so you do some of it before you get there and it also helps the line up at check in less of a wait time. Room was great we were at the back of the hotel... More"
"2 nights in the Aria were pure luxury. We had an interconnecting room with our teens and so lots of space for us to be tidy and them to make a mess! Obviously this is Vegas so everything else was expensive - the restaurants and parking etc, but as a treat it was perfect. The staff we met were polite... More"
"I had such a great experience at The Aria Oct.17-20th that I didn't leave the property until it was time to Uber back to McCarran.I was there for the canceled Stones show and Aria was buzzing with a great vibe.Room 21228 was immaculate and housekeeping were on their game.Every single employee I encountered was genuinely polite and gracious.Some of the... More"
"Another pleasant stay at Aria. Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view. Our rooms were on the 4th floor and all we could see was a/c equipment. Brick oven pizza was delicious and buffet filing."
"In August of 2015, we stayed at the Staybridge Suites as we prepared to celebrate the wedding of our son and his wife. We came in a few days ahead of the wedding party to help out her family with the details of the wedding. We reserved rooms for family, wedding party, and additional guests, having to change the reservations... More"
"This hotel is excellent, very clean inside out. I was given a massive room with a kitchen which was well stocked. Service was great and staff very friendly. The hotel is also located in a good place in walking distance of plenty of restaurants and a Starbucks. Will use again"
"Very good stay with lots of energy."
"I booked a weekend stay at the W for my bachelor party. I booked the room weeks in advance, but the staff said that my room was unavailable due to maintenance. I pressed for the room I booked and eventually got the room I wanted. On top of that, they included drink tickets. The trip started a little rough but it was great. Hotel is situated in a great place and all the amenities like the pool and bar were fantastic."
"The hotel I stayed is so-called a 3-star hotel, here was no hot water in my room and I couldn't take shower. Also the A/C in my room didn't work well either, and it cannot give me a comfortable temperature. Then I asked for additional blankets, but they said all were gone. Given such a bad situation, they said they... More"
"One of the best hotels I've stayed in - staff is great, location is perfect, and accommodation's/amenities A++ We plan on visiting this hotel again, even if just a weekend getaway. There are restaurants within walking distance, all the stores you would ever need for necessities, but hotel/room is quiet and comfortable."
"I was lucky to be upgraded to a lovely Jr suite with great views of the lake and park. Unfortunately, I was only in town for 24 hours so I couldn't fully enjoy the hotel."
"From start to finish the staff was super helpful. All staff genuinely seemed happy to work there and help guests. The room was comfortable and spacious (a corner room). The vibe is great hip and fun without the pretentiousness of some hipster places."
"I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!"
"Horrible smelly roomsasked for our money back ,since we could not have stayed in this place with my daughter having difficulties breathing in that smell.They told us they will refund-well,the money was never returned to my account.Even when asked a several times.Rude staff."
"Counter staff tried to be helpful, however my problem needed the manager's attention. He was not on site, but could be reached by phone, but refused to talk with me. The lobby smelled like smoke and I wanted to cancel my reservation., which required his ok. Refused to do that or talk with me about my concerns. Consider this motel... More"
"Great room. Great service. Excellent cleanliness. I'd recommend this facility to all of my friends and relatives. Great entertainment is near by. Wild Country night club. Felt safe coming and going."
"I stayed in the Pontchartrain Suite so that my daughter her 9 bridesmaids could get ready. It could not have been any better! It was spacious enough for everyone, plus the hair make-up crew, as well as friends stopping by. I'd highly recommend it!"
"While you can always look hard enough to find something wrong with a hotel, the Omni for our two nights there was excellent. We experienced a clean room, very friendly and helpful staff, good food, and location. The bellman went out of their way for us and we had no complaints. We would stay there again."
"I loved this hotel! Got in late to find the room lights and tv on! It was great, I didn't have to drag my bags into a dark room and find the lights. So, comfortable, great sleep and oh man great shower!!"
"The Omni Royal Orleans is a great place to stay in the French Quarter. A great, safe location near all of the action and within walking distance of many great restaurants. Rooms were very clean and quiet. The Rib Room restaurant has a good menu and the food is very good."
"Our upgraded balcony room over looked the dumpster. The housekeeping service was VERY POOR. The hotel billed for Wi Fi service that was not used. Towels were never replaced and we had to call for soap."
"The location of the hotel is perfect and we were able to walk to places like Caf DuMonde and Bourbon Street. There were several shops and restaurants within walking distance as well. Very clean hotel with a very attentive and courteous staff."
"My fianc and I LOVE NOLA! We've been two times in the last year and both times we stay at the Omni Royal. The staff is wonderful and always very accommodating! The location is perfect, only a few blocks from Bourbon, Jackson Square and Decatur!! We stayed in July of 2015 and October of 2015. In July we went up... More"
"This hotel was Amazing! Though it's not as hip as the W Hotel, The location is amazing - right across the street from K-Pauls and Nola's - two great restaurants. Also, the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer. I highly recommend this hotel!"
"I have stayed many times over the past several years at this classic hotel. The service from the front desk to the room attendants to the bartenders are top notch. The rooms have very comfortable beds with modern flat screen TV's. The pool is rooftop and has great views of the city. I highly recommend requesting a room on the... More"
"I am native to New Orleans, but live elsewhere currently, so I KNOW EXACTLY where to stay when visiting. The location is PERFECT, the hospitality is war and welcoming and the rooms are well appointed, spacious, quiet and comfortable. The hotel has entrances on both Royal (cafes, galleries, boutiques) and Chartres (Jackson Square), so it is central to EVERYTHING in... More"
"This was our first time visiting the city of New Orleans. The Omni was the PERFECT hotel. It is in the middle of the French Quarter, but not on crazy Bourbon Street. (You NEVER want to stay on Bourbon Street!!) The hotel was clean and elegant. Our room overlooked Royal Street, which is a beautiful street lined with art galleries,... More"
"We always stay at this hotel when visiting New Orleans. It is literally steps from some of the classic restaurants in New Orleans and close to Bourbon Street while still allowing for a good night's sleep. The staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. I recommend the larger rooms over the smaller ones, since the small rooms are really... More"
"Absolutely LOVED this hotel. Truly the best service, food and location. Classy and polite staff. Our banquet food was delicious and always fresh throughout the day. Staff would whisk away all dishes and place settings when we were finished and my glass or cup was never empty. Accommodations were great. Big beds, big rooms, big bathrooms and an amazing 360... More"
"We spent two relaxing nights at the Omni. Wonderful room, helpful staff. Rooftop pool and bar was terrific, a great place to view the City and River during the day or night. We didn'the try the hotel restaurant, since we were tempted by the aromas of other restaurants while walking the French Quarter."
"I would like to say thank you to all the staff, for our stay at the Omni. We were very much surprised when we got to the hotel. Loyalty Ambassador Tia A. Jackson contacted me in advance of our arrival and had ask if we had a special occasion, and I responded yes it was our 40th anniversary of our... More"
"The hotel is located on an excellent and very convenient block. Very close to the action, but about a block away from the action at the same time. So perfect for walking back from bourbon street without problems and close enough to walk to where you need to go in French Quarter. The hotel lobby doorman is a nice upscale... More"
"The room was very clean and you can't beat the location. The Riviera bar and pool on the roof is a nice amenity to have so you can relax for a few hours before the night life. You are walking minutes from whatever you want to do in the French Quarter."
"My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was our first time visiting NOLA. Since it was our first time visiting and we were celebrating a special occasion we booked a king suite with a balcony. The extra price tag was worth it. The balcony was amazing- we overlooked... More"
"The location, staff and hotel are fabulous! The hotel was full but I would've never known. It was quiet in the hallways. Everything is right on point. I travel a lot and this is my new favorite spot in NOLA!"
"Love the OMNI for many reasons, the only thing that is a huge disappointment each visit is the cigarette smoking being done in the outdoor areas that we are supposed to be able to enjoy fresh air (the pool, balconies, front door entrance). Rules need to be enforced, rude guests get mad if approached about taking smoking to appropriate areas."
"Omni Royal Orleans offered convenient location, and loads of amenities. The staff is gracious and really makes you feel at home from the second you arrive outside the front entrance. There is a restaurant downstairs where we had an excellent meal, and the lobby bar was fun and relaxing for cocktails. For American standards, the room is small. If you... More"
"Very friendly, great location in the French Quarter very comfortable. It was just down the sidewalk from Bourbon street but far enough to get away from the late night partying. I give it a 5 star rating."
"The room was very clean and beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were so very nice. The location of this hotel is perfect, right in the midst of downtown but not so loud that one cannot rest. We had the best time and this hotel, by far, is one of my favorites. We love the City of New Orleans... More"
"This was my first visit to NOLA and chose the Omni on a friends recommendation - was very pleased. Location is excellent, good service and friendly employees. Rooms are small (we upgraded to a deluxe room/queen (still small) but clean, comfy and great water pressure in the shower :). Bar lounge nice (singer Yadonna was very enjoyable). Good Rooftop...

"We basically picked this hotel off the internet by the nice picture. What a pleasant treat it was right from beginning to end! I cannot say enough about every aspect of this property and I will be staying there for certain on my next trip to New Orleans!"
"Lovely hotel, great pool, decent gym, good food, lovely courteous staff, perfect location. You really won't find better in the French Quarter. Only slight criticism is the rooms could be bigger. But they are very clean and well maintained with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. Wifi is free if you are staying there - just ask... More"
"Had our daughters wedding at the Omni Royal Orleans. All the staff was beyond fantastic. Everyone had a great time, the location of the property could not have been better. The quality of the hotel is great. We had a suite and it was perfect."
"My husband and I visited NOLA to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this past weekend. Upon our late arrival, we were greeted by the Valet and Bell Boy and quickly checked in for our stay. There was a mix up with the room key which stalled our 'settling' for 30 minutes, but we were told that the woman that assigned us the keys was on medication from a dental operation. The room was lush but small - neither of us minded, since we would be tourist hopping and eating all day any...view moreway. The view was great, and we were pleased that it was located far enough from Bourbon that you couldn't hear the crazy screaming drunkenness (though, Saturday was a bit louder than Friday). Room service was excellent and speedy. Information was readily available and the hotel was really clean. We didn't get to explore the upper deck pool area or dine at the Rib Room, but plan on staying here again - it's in the middle of everything and a really great value!view less"
"Stayed 3 nights for a conference. The rooms are small as this is a historic property, but very nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. There are dimmers on the lamps, robes and nice sheets. Outlets on side of bedside table. Lovely roof Pool and bar. Service was fabulous from fast check in to housekeeping to wake up calls."
"We arrived early and we hadn't slept. Our room wasn't ready. They finally gave us a room just to sleep in until our room was ready. Thank You!!!! Staff was friendly. Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze. Will definitely be back!! I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans. This one is my favorite."
"Finally Made a reservation with Omni after many attempts. Their reservation system would put call on hold for a long time. Should have been a warning on things to come I finally called the front desk and they connected me to reservations. Made a reservation to check in May 28th, three nights. Requested early check in This was a special... More"
"Bad: Short on hot water during the evening. It was fine during the morning hours. When I mentioned this at the desk they promised to look into it and adjusted my bill to compensate. Good: Very clean, attractive. Good value for the money."
"Good: excellent hotel in great position, very friendly efficient staff, great on site cooked breakfast, very good dinner menu and excellent evening bar. Well positioned for many restaurants in walking distance. Onsite pool and gym"
"When going places I like to see a landing point of a nice place of class. Clean rooms with a decent size to go along with it is a prayer."
"Not enough pillow, dingy shower curtains, bad TV reception. TV mounted in location that it hard to view television. Room almost 100.00 dollars, not worth it, will never stay there again."
"General manager was rude at checkin and would not let me checkin for an hour. I had pre arranged to have room prepaid and he refused"
"Really nice hotel in an awesome area of Cali. Love this city, A LOT!!"
"came here for a business trip, they accommodated us to no end. The staff really did a great job tending to us!"

"the rates are fabulas, the facilities are clean. The location is perfect. very impressed"
"This was a great place to stay. It was quiet. our room had a balcony with a view which is something we absolutely needed. The staff was nice and helpfull and the breakfast was exactly what we like. breads bagels yogurt fruit hard boiled eggs and cereals, perfect."
"The room was absolutely beautiful! We arrived before check-in, and our rooms were ready to go. There was an ample amount available for breakfast, and the wine and cheese nights were very relaxing and fun to attend. We met wonderful people staying at the inn with us... made the atmosphere very friendly and homey. The staff were an excellent group,... More"
"I am shocked how kind and courteous and simply nice the staff is at this hotel. The front desk ladies are fantastic. Kind, sweet, cute, and genuinely customer oriented. The evening Kick Back cocktail reception is amazing as well. Full on dinner if you like every night at 5:30pm with a full bar!!! And the food and beverage staff are... More"
"The two room suites are very clean an well maintained. We stay at Ocean Suites a couple of times a year and are always happy with the accommodations. The mini kitchen has a full size refrigerator, microwave, oven, coffee maker with coffee provided. Pots and pans along with dishes are provided. They even have coffee sweetener, a wine bottle opener,... More"
"The property is very attractive inside and out. When the sun came out I noticed flower baskets hanging under the staircase on the main building and some trumpet vine, and fuchsias blooming on the hillside. The decoration and practicality of the interior is very well planned. The interior pictures of nature and local scenery provided cheerful ambience. I noticed the... More"
"Nice hotel in SLO. staff was friendly and they had cookies and coffee when we checked in. Only minor complaint was the continental breakfast was a little on the light side. But there are plenty of places to eat in SLO so other than that it was great."
"My experience here was pretty Awesome! The staff was very Helpful with whatever I needed and any questions I had about the area! I Would Recommend This place over and over! Very Happy with Staying here!!"
"The staff was very friendly and they made check-in super fast. My family and I got there a little early they checked the room and since it was clean they got us in early. One of the best stays I've had in a hotel. We will definitely be staying here again in the future."
"Stayed for Business. Will not come back. The room was small for 2 beds. The Sheets had cigarette burnt stains."
"Worst place ever for family room was smelly and office staff not helpful"
"Furniture and fixtures were in desperate need of repair and updates. Desk was wobbly. Furniture was scratched. AC unit looked like it was going to die. Toilet seat was worn and needed to be replaced, etc."
"Stayed here for 10 nights Rooms very Clean, Kitchenette very very well provided paper Towel everything you need Except a kettle (hey I am British). The only one very little gripe more chairs outside would be good. Laundry room clean and washers and driers very good"
"My family found our way to Hyatt Valencia as a result of a catastrophic Gas Well blow-out. Governor Brown declared a state of emergency and more than 4,400 people from my community were relocated to hotels. It was our misfortune to wind up at the Hyatt Regency Valencia. They took FULL ADVANTAGE of the situation, of us, and even the... More"
"We booked this hotel last minute. We thought it was going to kind of A mediocre room. When we arrived there was plenty of parking and best of all parking is free. When checking in the two gals at the front desk were very pleasant. Check in was super fast and easy. When we arrived to our room we were... More"
"This Hyatt is a great place. Clean, quiet, friendly staff, nice bar, great happy hour, well located and responsive to your needs. We will stay here again without a doubt. It was a little noisy from other patrons slamming fire doors. That was not the hotel's fault. That came from people with no social graces."
"We were looking for a quick low key weekend escape to get out of the heat, without breaking the bank, Upon arrival, staff was friendly, check in was a breeze, the hotel and grounds were excellent. Location was close to dining, shopping and nightlife. Will definitely return!"
"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed. Terrible customer service. Bob"
"We had a room on the top Floor. Which was nice because you could see the sea It was very spacious and very clean. And a cosy fireplace. The room was up to date as well. It was nice to have some modern furniture for a change Breakfast was very good too but some fruit would be nice. Oh and... More"
"We had a great time!"
"Sink had leak, which soaked the entire counter top. Given rags to wrap around the faucet and told that no maintenance person available. Given option to move on last night there. Outlets do not work, plugs fall out. Coffee pot never cleaned out. Towels received were stained. On first arrival, toilet had some poop floating in it. Phone did not work, no dial tone, no way to contact front desk. Went to continental breakfast, and muffins were covered with ants. She put them away, but next morning, the muffins served were stale. I believe she saved them and served them the next day."
"Good location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Just a few minutes from the beach."
"Came out here to see my friends band play at the flats just across the street from Aloft! The hotel is in a great location! Great food all around and walking distance. Cool view of some huge bridge!

"Several years ago during an area ice storm and widespread power outage, our family checked into this hotel.

"Wedding party outside in pool area until 4:30 in morning. Very loud. Front desk was ignorant to whole event even tho you could see outside tables from lobby.

"we usually stay in Hilton Products. I had read an article about Drury and was intrigued so we decided to expand our horizons WOW, am I glad we did!

"I spent two days here on a business trip had never stayed in a Drury before. This was a very pleasant surprise.

Dogs are allowed to accompany guests, provided these are well behaved and do not disturb other guests. There is an adequate and FREE dinner, along with... More"
"We stopped at the Drury Inn on June 24th for a night as we headed to South Carolina. The Drury Inn was a pleasant surprise. It was a crowded night but everyone working could not have been nicer and efficient. We had a connecting room with family which was so helpful. The complimentary drink was a nice surprise and the...

"We usually look for Drury Inns when we travel. This location is very convenient off the highway. I liked the out door area by the pool. We had a great suite, highly suggest the suites to families. The mall is across the parking lot and convenient."
"When we came for a visit for a friend's wedding, we chose this hotel based on its price an amenities for our group of 5. Our suite with its two beds and sofa bed was roomy and had everything we needed for a good stay. The front room was rather dark, without windows, but was comfortable. The bathroom was nice... More"
"We were visiting our Hilton Head Hurricane Matthew refugee friends and ended up meeting them and staying 4 nights here. The front desk staff was wonderful, especially Dana, Mia, Lola and Geneva. It was a packed hotel and the staff could not have been more friendly, helpful and accommodating. They served a hot free breakfast, which was above average for... More"
"Have not stopped at a Drury Inn in quite a while. The last time we did was not a good experience. But because of the reviews decided to give Drury another chance. Glad we did. Do not hesitate to stop at this hotel."
"Mia met us with a generous smile at the front desk as we checked-in to this spacious, clean and wonderfully staffed facility. Drury Inns, a new and fully delightful discovery for this writer. Hallways are well illuminated and the entire building is scrupulously maintained. Economically priced well-appointed, well-lit, surgically clean rooms in excellent condition. Bargain price includes a kick-back evening... More"
"Very happily surprised :-)! Emerald greeted us with a great big smile and patiently waited while I rearranged my wallet to find my AARP card and got us booked into a beautiful suite. Drury will definitely be a go to from now on thanks to the fabulous service we received on our first stay: easy on/off interstate access, strong hot... More"
"I have just discovered the Drury Inns. We stayed in the University one last year and recently the Northlake location. You can not go wrong with either one. This Drury Inn like the other had a great staff. Lola and Ashley went above and beyond to make sure we had every thing we needed. They are both an asset to... More"
"This Drury is in a good location , right off 77, for a stop when driving south to Fla or Hilton Head. The staff is friendly, food is good. Breakfast has hot and cold selections, fruit and cereal. The 5:30 to 7:30 kickback varies but we had hot dogs, meatballs, pasta, salad, chips, soup...and free soda or 2 drinks. No... More"
"We stayed here for one night on our way to Northern Virginia with our son's and their families. This is one of the better hotels we have stayed in with the free drinks, free dinner and free breakfast, it can't be beat. This hotel is super clean, allows pets, and is in an easy on and off from I-77. There... More"
"We stayed here one night on our trip back to Ohio from South Carolina. Every staff member was so welcoming and friendly! The room was very clean, comfortable, and quiet. The food (dinner and breakfast) was simple, delicious, and pleased even our picky eater. The pool area was also clean. We really wish there were more Drury Inns to stay... More"
"I stay here often and will not stay any place else. Incredibly clean and superb staff. Hotel is in the heart of shopping and dinning. Much nicer than a Hilton or Marriott brand with outstanding breakfast and evening buffets that is included in the very affordable rate. Try it once and I bet you never stay anywhere else while in... More"
"Lovely big rooms, with big beds and the nicest bathroom I have seen in all our hotels on this trip. Sadly for us, the pool was closed for renovations and it would have been nice to cool off after a hot sunny day in California touring the wineyards. Hotel however has a little courtyard with tables and chairs so a... More"
"Our one night at this roach motel was awful. While the manager on duty was very pleasant, our room was less than satisfactory. There was no remote for the TV. The water in the bathroom ran lukewarm in the shower and sink. Two of our towels were a gross grey color. We asked for a non-smoking room but clearly someone had been smoking in our room quite recently. Worst of all, the people on either side of us decide... view mored to stand outside and talk very loudly until midnight. They screamed, yelled, slammed doors, and stomped back and forth for two hours. When we went to check out, there was no one available. We had to leave without being properly checked out. This roach motel is not worth the money."
"Nice room and friendly staff. Breakfast was definitely a plus, but nothing fancy. WIFI was good."
"Myself and my daughter (11) have just spent 7 nights at the amazing Coconut Waikiki Hotel in Honolulu - our girlie holiday. 23rd October 2015 to 30th October 2015. It was the first time to Hawaii for both of us and it is one holiday that we will be repeating. Oahu is the most relaxing destination that I have been... More"
"Front desk staff really embodied the aloha spirit. Chech in/out was the smoothest process I ever experienced. And they took the time to customize our accommodations. Heated pool and fresh homemade waffles at continental breakfast was an unexpected treat. Hotel is energy concious which I loved about them. And what's not to love Great location + great service great time."
"We love this place! They tried their best to make you feel at home! Even a free bottle of wine for our celebrations! It's so convenient to shopping malls and Waikiki beach! We got a mountain view room. U cannot imagine how wonderful the view is. Pretty mountain views, great riverside... Sunshine in the mornings. I mean it is way... More"
"We stayed there for our honeymoon and it was such a great experience. The front desk gave us the mountain view room on 9th floor, which has an awesome view of the Ala Wai canal and the mountain range. They also gave us a complimentary bottle of red wine. The included breakfast has a good array of food. The location... More"
"I actually booked this hotel while I was on the plane to Oahu. Before I came, I saw that it had 4 stars on Yelp and pretty high ratings here, so I booked a one-night stay to check it out. Check-in was easy, and Monique was very welcoming and friendly! I was a bit disappointed with the city view but... More"
"We've had many delightful visits to Waikiki and stayed in assorted hotels. Coconut Waikiki is our new favorite Waikiki home! The staff, rooms and even the other guests were all just right. We're all looking forward to many many happy returns."
"The Coconut Waikiki Hotel was a great hotel. We definitely enjoyed our stay here. I had originally requested one king sized bed but we got 2 beds instead which worked out as we had our 9 month old daughter with us. The room was bright and clean. The Wifi was fast. The location itself was excellent, it was close to... More"
"The hotel was small but looked newly renovated. I came with my boyfriend who was visiting me from out of town and I live in Hawaii so we decided to spend a night here. The hotel staff was very friendly and gave us a room upgrade and a bottle of wine to share and enjoy on them for staying with... More"
"The hotel is in a very nice residential street of Waikiki which makes it close enough to all the action but still walking distance to it all. The staff is very nice and attentive. I stayed here after a long day of traveling and the staff could have not been any more accommodating. Even gave me an upgrade! Sleek, fun,... More"
"Awesome service! Tidy! Hygenic Clean!Provide beach towels for free. Great advice for restaurants from the front desk. Easy to use washing machines and dryers (2 of each). Complimentary coffee, water toiletries. Breakfast is nice and light. Perfect for on the go. We had room 404 facing the canal. I would definitely recommend asking for a room higher (5+)... More"
"We only stayed one night but enjoyed our stay. The hotel is one of the cheaper options for decent accommodation in waikiki. Staff are super friendly and efficient. They have the right attitude for the jobs they do. Mike who sorts luggage/valet cars is great - a gem! Breakfast was not great for us but we are pretty fussy and... More"
"My friends and I stayed at this hotel earlier this month and could not have been happier with our choice! The rooms were nice and very clean. We had a room with two beds overlooking the mountains and canal and it was a good amount of space for the three of us. The location was exactly where we wanted to... More"
"My husband and i went to Hawaii to celebrate our honeymoon. When we searched for hotels we found the coconut waikiki hotel which seemed to look good on pictures. Once we arrived we got a whole other opinion about the hotel. Staff was not friendly, rooms were old fashioned, pool was very small.. But the worst thing of all is... More"
"We had a great stay at the hotel. Very friendly staff and beautiful location just a few blocks back from the main street of shops. Would highly recommend to anyone travelling to Waikiki. I would say that the friendly staff were what made our stay here most enjoyable."
"I love staying at the coconut Waikiki!! Everybody was so friendly and helpful!! The breakfast was amazing and the rooms so relaxing!! I loved waking up to the sunrise and how conveniently close the shops were. Bars were down the street with great happy hour and the royal Hawaiian center had plenty shops and a food court! Minutes away from... More"
"Stayed here as part of a bigger American adveture with my new husband! The hotel was very centrally located and very close to all the tres fancy shops and beach! The staff were friendly and were always on hand to recommend good local restaurants. We had a mountain view room which was big and always kept clean and tidy. The... More"
"I'm not really a big fan of this type of suite. The last thing I want to do on a vacation is cook or do dishes. But I just ignored the kitchen area and the hotel was better than fine. The rooms were spotless. The bed was very comfortable. The amenities nice (free wi-fi was dependable, that's unusual). I cannot... More"
"I have stayed at this hotel several times and every time something little was wrong but we overlooked it. As I was checking in the front desk/manager told me that my room was a problem room 312 because people smoke in it. She said there was a smoke smell and smoke burns. That was the least of the problems when... More"
"Get more than what you pay for, Hotel ran well and good atmosphere. Very accommodating."
"My husband and I were on a mission to buy a new truck. We had driven several hours that night just to make it to TN. The staff was wonderful. The woman who greeted us was very accommodating, especially being that we didn't arrive until 2:30am. Even upon leaving early the next morning, she told us to stay longer the... More"
"This hotel met Hampton's high quality standards. Rooms were comfortable and clean, bed was great, staff was friendly and helpful. This is why I stay at Hampton's, you know in advance of the quality of service. Did not have a chance to use the pool or exercise area but there is a lovely walking trail around the hotel. We stayed... More"
"I travel to Athens several times a year and have been for the past 14 or so years. I've always tried to stay in hotels in downtown. There aren't that many and this particular they were all booked so I made reservations at the Hampton Inn. I've never had any issues with this brand of hotel in the past, but... More"
"It was very clean and nice. It was more expensive than I normally pay. (I am willing to sacrifice a good bit just to pay less but, my aunt wanted to stay there). The staff was friendly and helpful. You will like it."
"Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors. Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all. Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty. The best positive was that the room was clean and updated."
"I travel extensively and normally visit at least three states per month for work. Hilton family hotels are my preference when I travel and I have stayed at a lot of them. While not the fanciest hotel in their portfolio (that would probably be the Waldorf Rome Cavalieri where we stayed two years ago), the Hampton Inn and Suites in... More"
"The staff went above and beyond expectations. Always ready to help. The breakfast always had something everyone wanted to eat. They never ran out of food and the lady in the kicthen was very nice and helpful. She did an excellent job. The desk staff were very nice, always smiling and asking if there was anything they could do. The... More"
"Very clean hotel, with friendly, efficient staff. Pool area was small, but impeccably clean and enjoyable. The hot breakfast was delicious and included omelets and waffles as well as cereals, breads/pastries, sausage, hash browns, hot chocolate, etc... Location good with multiple stores and restaurants nearby. The only minor flaw was the noise of the heat/air system, but definitely easy to... More"
"Quick check in, clean and comfortable large room. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Complimentary breakfast was excellent for this type of hotel. My only suggestion is that they please stock some plain black tea (only flavored teas were available). All staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming."
"The people at the front desk are rude and not helpful. If there is a concert the weekend you are looking to book, they just hang up on you. What do they care, the hotel is already booked. Low class service."
"Have been staying here since they opened in June. Each visit was good. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Missed not,having the pancake machine working! I would recommend this hotel. A very nice and new hotel."
"As soon as you enter this hotel you notice its not part of a national chain. This is a one-off, very hip hotel. Its not just the look and feel of the place, its the staff. Whoever is running this place has instilled a sense of pride in everyone who works there... everyone. Our rooms were fantastic with a whirlpool... More"
"The lady at the front desk was a bit rude. The gentleman that was there later in the evening was a blessing."
"enjoyed the pool and hot tub my grandkids especiallydid"
"The little cousin to Hilton Garden Inn with just as much to offer. Great location on the river and paths for a morning jog or walk or kayak! Near restaurants, friendly staff, clean and spacious rooms, and a nice breakfast. Good for family or business travel."
"Spent a few nights in Bend and this place was fantastic. The location is right near the Old Mill district on the river which is a great spot. There are plenty of places to eat, shops and cinemas all within a stones throw. I believe you can hire bikes and ride along the river as well. The location isn't too... More"
"Wonderful experience again. Have stayed here a lot and it is always pleasant. Quiet, good breakfast, clean, good pool. Easy to get to, a pleasure to experience. Upholds Hilton Honors reputation. I do not know what else to say to reach 200 characters. I think I've covered everything."
"This Hotel exceeded every need we had. We were expecting mediocre at best and everything was 5 Star. Room was exceedingly clean. Room was quiet. Breakfast was unbelievable. Check in and Check out were a breeze!"

We were so pleased with our room, the whole experience was just delightful. Our adult children wanted to stay there on their way back to Calif. because of our praise ...this place stays fairly booked... More"
"We have driven through Grants Pass, OR several times. This trip we were in town for a conference and when the host hotel was sold out we were referred to the Riverside Inn by the conference organizers. I looked on the Riverside Inn website and decided to book directly. Based upon the pictures on line, I must say I was... More"
"My husband and I spent 4 nights here. This is the place to be if you are tired of generic chains. Peaceful, comfortable and the owners are super nice people, very friendly and accommodating. Loved every minute this is where will always stay while in Grants Pass."
"Stayed in the hotel to try it out after very fond memories of staying in the Staybridge Suites in Ballantyne, NC (I did a company relo and my family lived in this hotel for 6 months - just a great place). I travel to Virginia for business quite frequently and wanted to try out a new hotel. I typically stay... More"
"This hotel has an amazing staff from the GM, to the front desk, down to the breakfast and cleaning crew. My king suite was spacious and very clean!! The evening meals combined with ice cream socials are amazing. Reserved parking spots for IHG Platinum and gold members is a plus. The free hot breakfast has everything you want plus yogurt,... More"
"I was very impressed with the rooms and felt like I was in an apartment. We stayed in a 3 bed 2 bath suite as a way for all the bridesmaid to be in one place the night before the wedding. The living area was very cozy and even with five people we never felt short on room. The kitchen... More"
"We stayed for 11 nights and this hotel is absolutely wonderful. We had a king suite with separate bedroom and it was contemporary, comfortable and well-appointed. The complimentary, hot breakfast is plentiful and tasty. The complimentary guest laundry was an added bonus (bring your own soap or buy in the pantry next to front desk). Service with a smile from...

"We recently had a block of rooms for our guests for our daughter's wedding. Charlie and his efficient staff could not have been more helpful, welcoming and accommodating to our needs. All our guests commented on their friendliness, and beautiful, clean rooms. Most of them took advantage of the inclusive breakfast next door at Hayden's Lakeside Grill. Although it is... More"
"Traveled with my family for the 5A state championship in Hillsboro, but found almost all of the hotels in the area were full. Found this little gem in Forest Grove, and enjoyed it far more than we expected to. The place was impeccably clean, and the staff was excellent. My kids loved the pool, and the hot tub was great...

"This is the place to stay if you are visiting the university. Great price if you book online at the discounters' websites! Very friendly, hardworking staff. Informative about the area. I will/would stay there again."
"Not sure what people expect out of a 54 hotel but some of the reviews I read are ridiculous.... small bathroom, what do people expect, a dance floor! I travel to Corvallis nearly every month and have stayed at nearly every hotel in town and while yes this place is dated, (orange carpet) it was very clean, had extremely nice... More"
"I have stayed here many times. It is always very clean, friendly, and affordable. Its a pretty new facility but the prices are still low. My favorite thing is that they don't have FOX NEWS on in the lobby so I don't have to listen to hate speech while I get my breakfast."
"Ever since Danny took over La Quinta Corsicana, it has become an awesome hotel. It is clean, beautiful and everyone is friendly and efficient. The pool is heated!! The spa is wonderful! AND it is pet friendly!! It is an excellent choice and we are so grateful for them!"
"Rooms were large, bed was comfortable, location was adequate. Motel needs some serious updates. Renovations are a must. Outside area was dirty and customers were allowed to work on their automobiles in the parking lots. My spouse and I will not again stay again without some of these things are fixed."
"This is by far the Best La Quinta we have ever stayed in. Everything was new and up to date. Extremely CLEAN!!!! Very nice friendly staff. This one actually served a hot breakfast besides to token waffle. Loved the stay."
"I had a great experience at this hotel. Everybody is friendly and the rooms are very clean. I utilized the fitness center to help me maintain my work out regiment. Kendra was my favorite employee. I would definitely stay here again because of the ease of access in location and friendly customer service."
"Came for a weekend with a child. The front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Breakfast was stocked and ready. Pool area was clean and the rooms were very nice. Would definitely recommend. Had no complaints at all. They are located a little off the beaten path but it was nice and quiet."
"This was an excellent hotel. Very clean and updated. Nice comfortable beds and covers. The complimentary breakfast had a huge selection and something for everyone. The only draw back was it was on the expensive side, but I guess you get what you pay for because I can't think of anything to complain about. Lol."
"Best Holiday Inn we have stayed in ever and we have stayed in a few, wonderful reception from the lady at the front desk, we where upgraded to a suite and what a room, big, clean, desk lounge everything you need when travelling. This hotel will probably make the rest of our stays in hotels across the U.S. a... More"
"This Holiday Inn Express was very clean. The beds were super comfortable. The location was right off I-40.

The next morning enjoy a really good cup of coffee.... More"

"I'm driving back to NC from RI and I needed to get some sleep. I checked into this room and the front desk clerk was nice and prompt. As I walked into my room, I hear the phone ring and it's the front desk ask me to keep the noise down, I am all alone and just walked in this... More"
"I stayed here for one night because the official hotel for the Trenton Half was booked by the time I knew I would need a room. I've had good experiences at other Comfort Inns so I figured this was a safe choice. When I walked in the lobby looked like it was under renovation. Not a big deal. What was... More"
"We had a reservation last month. On our way to this hotel, my daughter got sick in the car. And we made the choice to return home and cancel our vacation (we had Sesame Place and Dutch Wonderland in mind). We called Comfort Inn and explained our situation. Our hotel booking was non refundable and obviously we called with less... More"
"We were using this hotel for a family of 5 in conjunction with Sesame Place. The key factors for us were the included mini-fridge (not a simply cube, it had to be large enough to accommodate a 6 year old, 3 year old, and 1 year old), and a microwave, as well as being large enough to include a Pack...

"Every staff member very accommodating, welcoming and friendly!"
"This hotel is a splendid option for anyone who is to leave on a bus from the downtown area and looking for an inexpensive way to spend their last night in the city.

"Said they upgraded me....I went from a singke king to a double bed room. Not much of an upgrade"
"Clean well-furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave. Fitness room with up-to-date equipment. Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub. I was pleased to see there was a lift to help someone with mobility problems get into/ out of pool. Staff was pleasant and professional."
"I had booked a room via a 3rd party, but arrived late and the only room available was one for people with pets. I couldn't take that spring allergies would have had me sneezing all night in such a room. So the manager graciously gave me a suite at the same price. Nice service!"
"This hotel was great! Our company held their meetings there we had catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner by the hotel. At night after our meetings it was great to go to the Casino and the tavern was a cool hangout place."
"I was unsure about staying here after reading some reviews. .stayed 5 nights for business. I found the room very nice. .bed comfortable.

"We have stayed at the Warner many times. Always clean, very helpful staff and right in downtown West Chester, close to everything. Limited parking on site but discount parking available near by. Lots of nice shops and restaurants , just walk out the front door. They tend to fill up fast so book early."
"This Motel will be the last place in Washington, Pa I would ever stay again. The rooms say no smoking, yet the bed spread and blanket had burn holes in them. The furniture was old and broken. The bathroom was newly finished, yet had BLACK MOLD on the walls .When I let them know at the front desk, they really... More"
"I hate writing reviews like this as a guy that owns a business, but you really shouldn't stay here... I knew going into this that i was getting a worker's hotel, but I didn't expect the used condom left in the garbage in my room, or the window that didn't have locks. I appreciate the new carpet and counter and... More"
"Had a very good dinner took my husband for his birthday dinner.had seafood raviolis and wings very good. Nice bar very lovely bartender.homecooked meals."
"Everything was great. Beds a little stiff, something slightly softer would have been great. No bacon at breakfast, bacon at breakfast would be an improvement also. Everyone was very nice and the value was good."

"I visited my old neighborhood for a few days. The clerk recognized me from a previous stay when I checked in. Hotel personnel called a cab twice, with a rapid response. The computer in the business center wasn't working, so they printed my boarding pass at the front desk."
"We stayed here for an entire week while attending a family reunion right down the road. If you are looking for the Ritz, keep looking.

"Just traveling through and needed a place to sleep. We could not have found a better place. Wonderful staff, what was left. Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday! What a great gesture! Clean, comfortable bed, nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast. The only negative was we could hear other guest talking when we were in the bathroom and other noises from our room. Easy on and off I 94. 10 day road trip and this was one of the best."
"every was pleasent and helpful. clean room, the door could of used a some oil really noisy"

"We stopped here without a reservation on our way to Myrtle Beach. The room was clean and comfortable with 2 queen beds and easy access on the first floor. This hotel is right off the highway and close to some decent restaurants. When we arrived they had a cooler full of lemon ice water and fresh popcorn. The breakfast was... More"
"From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty! Every.Single.Time we came back from whatever we were doing,we were greater with hello and how are you!!! Beds were comfy,pillows were too. Rooms were spacious. If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it. My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it.We did not eat breakfast there but I'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff ) Hotel is close to EVERYTHING.We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it. You sure can't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel. Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome!"
"Room smelled musty, carpets and bedding had a sticky feel. Pool out of order. Keep driving and don't stop here."
"I was directed to the rear entrance but was unable to use the key card to open the door. This was evidently true for everyone as I heard loud banging on the door until I checked out. Also awakened by loud talking in the hall and barking dogs in the morning. Room was clean and nicely furnished but cheap, only... More"
"The manager did everything to make our stay as easy as possible. Very accommodating!! Breakfast was great like at all the other ones we stayed in, the room was a great size and set up for our family. I would highly recommend!"

"This was the last stop on our marathon trip home from South Florida. Check in was a breeze and there were plentiful luggage carts to bring in our belongings. Staff suggested a parking location that made unloading a breeze. Room was clean and spacious and breakfast was fully stocked by the two cheerful staff members who were present. Pool and... More"
"I booked a convention at the last minute and found the ALOFT incredibly affordable, almost 90 dollars less than the Hyatt and the Westin. This is a new hotel and is in impeccable condition. The room is large with an large shower and bath area, large desk for work . The staff was incredibly nice and inviting , The ALOFT... More"
"Excellent hospitality from check in to check out. Great value. Price includes drinks and light supper which was very child friendly and hot/cold breakfast that will bring us back"

"Thank you Kayla, Clay, Amyjo and Christina for always taking care of my needs. Hotel is the tops in Butte. Thank you for always having clean amenities. The bedroom is very clean, the bed is very comfortable. Great views of the mountains and the town from the rooms. I will be visiting again thanks to you"
"Clean, newly remodeled hotel. Quiet rooms, and a helpful staff. Breakfast was decent as far as hotel breakfasts go, and internet speed was better than average for a hotel as well. If you have to spend two weeks in a hotel, There are worse places to do so."
"We loved this hotel, it was a little further away from the hustle and bustle of the quarter which was perfect for us. We was in town for the football game so it was right in our budget for a quick overnight stay. The hotel was clean, beds were comfy, and everyone was super polite."
"My hubby and I first stopped here on July 28 and this is our 3rd time back since. We love the bloody Mary's and the food has been great every time. They have just recently started to serve breakfast and it was very good. We will be back... Obviously."
"This was a great stopover on our way to LA. Helpful staff. Rooms were very nice. Great for family travel. Lancaster was a bit out of the way but it worked fine for a late night and early morning. I was traveling with 3 teens so the two room suite with 2 queen beds really helped. Comfy beds, nice kitchenette.... More"
"The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me. He offered me a pet friendly room, but it was not accessible. (I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!"
"We stayed in a newly renovated room. It was very clean and very comfortable. WiFi was free. There was an onsite computer for guest use. Breakfast was adequate. Coffee was good. The hotel, considering the room rate and proximity to ammenities, and cleanliness, it cannot be beat."
"Very close to the Soco District and St Edward's University which was convenient since we were there to visit the school. Looks brand new. Rooms were spacious and super clean."
"Went to the Memorial Day Celebration at the Texas State Cemetery like we do every year!! Close, with a Huge Room and Great Staff, KK Donuts in the Hotel Parking Lot, Good Pool and Great Breakfast as Well!"
"No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much."
"This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly. Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price."
"Needed a quiet place to spend the night during a cross country trip. This was in a quiet location and there was no noise heard from adjoining rooms. Wifi worked well and I got a good nights sleep. This is all I look for in a hotel. Would stay there again."
"We visited Uno's this past winter. The atmosphere is great, the servers were cutious and very nice people, and the pizza was killer. The manager came out and asked us how we were, this is always a good sign of a well ran restaurant. The waitress took very good care of us, and yes at the time there was not alot of business due to snowfall that day, she did stop to have a conversation with us. The food was excellant, very well garnished and flaverfull, and I can not remember having deep ...view moredish pizza that great! Uno's is one of the best restaurants Peoria, Il has to offer.view less"

There were buffet offerings as well as made to order waffles and omlets. The bar tenders were very accommodating. The rooms were clean and well decorated. Close to... More"
"This hotel has a historic, mixed with modern ambiance. It's a few blocks from the Illinois River with restaurants and the Spirit of Peoria riverboat. The staff was so nice and breakfast was wonderful. The bar had great entertainment too......,...................."
"Everything went as planned. Nice free breakfast. The free WiFi was a bit slow, the TV/Cable had some quirks but was manageable (no HD). The pool was bath temperature (Very Warm!). Shower had nice pressure, and the beds were firm but not hard. We had a problem one night with the lock on the bathroom door and the folks at the front desk were helpful."
"We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey. Would definatly recommend staying here."
"This is an upscale, modern hotel with the camaraderie of a hostel. The huge lobby has a giant fireplace, a billiards table, and a full bar, where guests were hanging out and socializing. Our room was attractive but smallish. The only hassle was that they charged for the breakfast on a per-item basis, which was mediocre quality and expensive. However,... More"
"This hotel is super!!The staff is friendly, and very competent. The room was spacious, and clean, and the bed comfortable. The location is good, and there is a restaurant around the corner. Very quiet."
"Stayed there just for a weekend trip for a wedding and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the hotel was for the price! The breakfast in the morning was good for a hotel and for being included with plenty of options to choose from. The rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable. All in all, I would definitely stay here... More"
"We have driven by this property several times on our way to and from the Gulf Coast...even watched it get built. We were coming back from FloraBama with our 3 year old granddaughter and decided to splurge a little and take advantage of this Hotel and it's indoor/outdoor pool. Everything about this place was 1st class...good check-in with Toni, nice... More"

"I travel alot on business and go back to the same places often and have a hotel that I think is good so stick with it. Well this time I went on trip advisor first, so this hotel was 1 and decided to give it a try. What can i say but it was a totally different experience. The hotel... More"
"Staff does a very nice job. The second location I have stayed at and both experiences have been great. Close to downtown Franklin, 20 minutes to downtown Nashville. Very quiet and comfortable. Our stay at their location in Findlay, Ohio was equal to this."
"Can't say enough about our stay at this Drury. It was in a very convenient location to local attractions, shopping, and restaurants (one attached to the hotel). The staff was helpful and cheerful and the place was spotless. Very happy to see this chain expanding to new areas of the country."
"This hotel is great! The amenities are really nice. The bathrooms are nice, and have the best showers of any hotel I have ever stayed at. I'll certainly stay here again. All the staff is fantastic. Teri and Charlie during Kickback are especially fantastic and help to make your stay fun."
"You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel."
"We spent several days here as a rest stop on a long bicycle tour. The person at the desk was very helpful. We were checked in well before the standard check-in time. The room is spacious, well arranged, and comfortable. Breakfast is tasty. Cookies at 7pm. Convenient walk to great restaurants and wine tasting rooms. Clean room and great air... More"

It's a short walk to downtown, the rooms have an upscale decor and are very comfortable and clean, the beds are excellent, the front desk is helpful, and the free breakfast is not bad at all (decent selection by current standards -- which are admittedly not very high... More"
"What I Expected"
"The sink kept backing up. The bathtub leaked. There were gnats flying around i think because of the clogged drain. The air I on 60 degrees and it never got cold in the room before it would cut off for very long periods of time. Went in the pool night before we left broke out the next day all over. Jacuzzi was nice. room 118 beware"

This Hotel and it's staff... More"

"We spent 4 glorious days at this resort in Deland, for a family reunion. We had booked eight rooms, one of which fronted the river. From our first introduction to Gary and Tammy, we knew we had picked a great spot. They were very friendly and accommodating to our requests. They went out of their way to insure everything was...

"This morning I called to inquire about the availability for a five night stay wanting to give this property another chance from a previous unpleasant experience. A couple of months ago, I called to inquire about a stay and had experienced poor customer service. At that time, I wrote it off as perhaps the representative was having a bad day.... More"
"This hotel was probably the cleanest I've ever seen. Not only lobby, but pictures in room were dusted and clean! Every staff encountered was friendly and spoke. Only ate breakfast in the restaurant, but everything was great. Definitely will be returning during warmer weather!"
"I spend a lot of my life in hotels and I can say I hardly ever review them. The service at this location, is so great though it is hard to not say anything. We recently had our meeting at this location and they took great care of us. Ivana made the rental process easy and painless. Then there was... More"
"OH MY! We had no idea what to expect, but when we arrived, we were BLOWN away. Staff goes out of their way to be friendly. Martisha at the front desk made a first impression that never wavered. The food from the grill by the pool was DELICIOUS! The beds were comfortable. Rooms were quiet at night. This quickly became... More"

Russ is so helpful, knowledgeable and relaxed that we all can't wait to see him. We have sent many groups his way and everyone feels the same. Scalloping with native sun tours is a... More"

Within minutes we were checked in and off... More"
"This is a very nice hotel in a small town. Very clean, new and up to date. The staff was very friendly, the place was clean and orderly. I'd stay here again without hesitation. Not much to do or eat in Mulberry, but take a 15 minute ride down the road to Lakeland and you can find anything and everything... More"
"Dirty, old soap on floor of shower, real thin 2 towels, only 1/2roll TP, bed real soft lumpy, no water glass, smelled moldy, the AC Was so noisy whenever it decided to cycle would wake up Rip VanWinkle. I looked for Cheep and I got it."
"The staff are very helpful and friendly and the rooms, large, clean and well appointed. We had nice linens too.

I appreciated the safety of his intentions but, I don't believe I ever signed up for that part of him being a manager. Joseph (male maid) likes to go into peoples rooms while they... More"

"What a wonderful stay. It was our parent's 50 Year Anniversary and the hotel was amazing. The staff (especially Chris at the front desk) with restaurant recommendations and a local florist that delivered flowers that the hotel made sure where in the room when we arrived. Also, the champagne that was waiting with the flowers (charge of 28 but the champagne was great). All of the front desk staff, throughout the weekend, was so accommodating. We will definitely be back."
"We were in the area at another hotel which we found was under construction, frustrated and upset, we called Seacrest and were able to book a room last minute.

"We stayed here as part of our road trip and found it to have nice rooms and views, both from the pool area and room balcony.

"It's rare that we ever stay in an independent hotel, but that's mostly what you find in Pismo Beach. From the first greeting to every contact with staff the customer service is excellent. The hotel has obviously been remodeled and the decor and rooms are very competitive to a Marriott Courtyard. The location is great and hotel has a stairway... More"

"With no great expectations we stayed at Sea Crest as a stop over on our way to LAX. We were very happy with the well appointed room with a beautiful view.

"My wife decided we should stay in Pismo Beach, and this hotel was right on the water, and was completely great. Friendly staff, beautiful room, great views. Excellent continental breakfast, excellent restaurant advice. We were delighted."
"Had a really lovely time at Seacrest oceanfront. We weren't overly happy with the first oceanfront room as the balcony was small and restricted the view so we were delighted to be moved to a ground floor room. The little extras added to the experience. The breakfast was good - the afternoon cookies enjoyed and the staff very helpful. Best... More"
"We had a great time enjoyed the great service, and how we were able to walk right to the beach. The breakfast in the morning was great we would recommend it to our friends. We can't wait to come back again"

"Nothing thing was nice worst hotel I had ever in my life"
"THE STAFFS HAVE NO MANNERS, THE ROOM WAS DIRTY, PILLOWS WERE STING, THE ELEVATOR HAD WATER, WE NEED TO BRING OUR LUGGAGE UP TO GET OUT OF THE DIRTY WATER."
"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul."
"92.50 for the smallest, dirtiest, hideous,smoke smelling room I've ever stayed in. Management is white trash and extremely rude to customers. There is no reason to ever stay in this hotel, it's garbage and should not be open to the public."
"My family and I booked this hotel for 5 nights through booking.com while in town for the LA marathon. It was a great deal: close to Dodger stadium for the start, had free wifi and breakfast and the price was better than most we had been seeing in town about this time. It was quiet the rooms were very clean... More"
"Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips! If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions. Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers!"
"Great Room! We came to Scottsdale to sight see, service was great, Front desk, house keeping and the Bistro( Mauro and Ed were great) went out of there way to make us feel comfortable! Hotel is very Quiet."
"I was not surprised by the excellent service and individual attention which was given to me other wedding guests that stayed at this lovely property. Marriott is know for its' excellent service and attention to detail regarding its guests. The accommodations are always immaculately maintained, the front desk staff is always willing to assist regarding any reasonable request. I am a travel concierge, because of their stalwart commitment to service, I will continue to recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to my clients. Lisa and Jean welcomed me and additional family members and ensured that we were well informed regarding shopping opportunities close by. We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional. While the entire hotel staff was amazing, I can't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness...Well Done!!!"
"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather"
"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!"
"We stay here every time we visit Palestine. The pool is warm and salt-filtered, so no chlorine burning eyes. We love making hot waffles at the complimentary hot breakfast. The staff are friendly, smart, and helpful. The beds are soft and cozy. Everything is spotlessly clean. You just couldn't ask for anything more."
"Very nice Hampton. We had a King suite on the first floor. It is the newer style Hampton rooms. Very large and spacious. Close to restaurants. Walmart nearby. Try Switch pizza for a local dining experience. Small, local pizza. Also near Applebees, Subway, McDonalds. !0 Minutes to Texas State RailRoad. It is near a train track so we did hear... More"

I would recommend. The Breakfest offerings were better than other hotels and the business center was clean and well stocked."
"The hotel features several wonderful amenities. The hotel looks like it is a brand new hotel in a five star city. Very classic and elegant features.

"The Chocolate Turtle may be the best b b I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. Every possible need of travelers was anticipated.

The hosts of... More"

"Stayed here for one night while in town to see a show. As noted, the staff was very friendly. Even though I wouldn't call it a wine tasting, the little happy hour they provide is unique and a cute amenity. Our room was small, but that was expected. Plus, it was clean. More than anything, free Wi-Fi is always a... More"

"I chose this place due to the trip advisor reviews and I can agree that it is a great little place. I was travelling by myself for work and I was immediately made very welcome. The room was clean and tidy and the bed was super comfortable. Every evening the staff put out some wine and nibbles from 5-7pm. I... More"
"I was only here for one night before a cruise and it could not have been better. The room was small, but clean and the staff could not have been more accommodating. It is very close to attractions, bars, restaurants and shopping. I would recommend it and would stay here again. For being small, they provide a very good selection... More"
"Came to Long Beach from the Bay Area for a business meeting and hadn't stayed there in a long time. Checked TA and picked this small, boutique hotel for it's location and reasonable price. I had a nice stay, but needed a little help with a business (Travel Card) related issue. Bottom line is that they went out of their... More"
"This boutique hotel has excellent customer service and a personal one on one experience for all the visitors. All of the staff will gladly accommodate all of your special requests including extra pillows and more ice! The daily happy hour is worth checking out to meet all the other guests and offers many opportunities to make new friends and share... More"
"This was hands down one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at. Granted I wasn't spending a lot of time around a pool or in my room but its located nicely and had amazing beds. The most important factor was the customer service. When I pulled into this hotel in my taxi, the staff was out the door to... More"
"On the up side, the staff is very helpful and welcoming, the rooms are very clean, the beds very comfortable, and the breakfast selections fresh and good quality. Within a block, there is a stop for the free Long Beach shuttle buses, as well as a stop for the regional transit light rail. On the downside, the rooms and public... More"
"I can see why this place is 1 on Trip Advisor. The best and most friendly, kind, caring, catering and professional service I have ever received.

"Booked this hotel as our first stop on our USA roadtrip based on budget so didnt have any expectations on arrival. We drove there from LAX and it was a very easy drive, sat nav got us there in no time. From the second we stepped into the hotel reception area we were greeted by the most welcoming staff ever....

"Probably the worst ever. Incredibly distasteful. No hot water. Inoperable phone in room. Overcharged for parking. Deceptive pricing. No bathroom in room. Discourteous staff. The list goes on and on. The hotel itself isn't so bad, and it's in a very good location. It could be a nice place, and looks like a quaint old hotel. Don't understand the way... More"

The room and hotel is spotless, staff very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend and will stay again."
"I stayed at the hotel while attending the Harvard LEV program. The room was luxurious, spacious and had all the comforts needed for this busy week. Wifi was a little inconsistent, but not too challenging. I would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Cambridge."
"I'm a Cambridge native. It used to be (during the 1950s) that working class people lived next to the academics and professionals. Cambridge had a small town feel and it was affordable for everyone. That's no longer the case. The Charles Hotel is pricey, but not much more than less grand places in Cambridge, especially if you get the package... More"
"I spent 10 days here in May - my third visit. I had a great room looking out over Cambridge. The room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable. The location is great - close to Harvard, shops, restaurants, the T, the river, etc. The staff were very helpful. The restaurant is good for breakfast and meals. The fitness centre is... More"
"We spent one night in Cambridge and the Charles Hotel was a perfect choice. Our room was on the 10th floor in their renovated section. It was spacious, comfortable and very nicely appointed. The concierge was very helpful in letting us know how we should make our way down to the fireworks. We were also given a late checkout to... More"
"We stay here every time we're in Cambridge. It's just a stone's throw from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, so the location is perfect. On this visit, our room had a great view (we could almost see the River). The hotel is contemporary, but not in a cold, overly-sleek way. It has several restaurants, one of which occasionally doubles... More"
"Stayed at the Charles Hotel over Christmas / New Year with the family. The room, staff and hotel in general were brilliant. I particularly recommend the hotel restaurant, Henrietta's Table, serves marvellous locally-sourced food."
"Room was comfortable with a lovely view and well lit with natural light.it is quiet and nearby are some very good restaurants. Great location for family vacation. Will return wherever we visit Boston again"
"Great hotel with great proximity to Cambridge and Harvard. Restaurants, services and gym are fantastic. Pricey but generally worth it. Connected to large independent fitness club so no fears of arriving in the morning and finding all the equipment taken. Henrietta's Table restaurant is great for breakfast - either business breakfast or with family."
"Had a great time at our friend and mentor's 90th birthday party! It was great seeing so many old friends and acquaintances. Setting was great at Regattabar, food exceptionally good. We stayed one day beyond the block reservation period, your reservation staff was good in accommodating a lower rate than the exorbitant rack rate (over twice the block rate for... More"
"We had a standard room at The Charles Hotel, but I was so impressed with the use of space - I might as well have been in a suite! There was plenty of room for both my husband and I to be comfortable with our own space for computers reading. The furniture was very functional for living and very... More"
"The staff was very professional and courteous. They provided excellent services like the shuttle and gave excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. They even gave me walking directions on how to get to the restaurants and even offered the shuttle. My room was clean."
"Great place to stay in Madison. The rooms are very quiet and clean. The beds are very comfortable and the shower is fabulous. Our large dogs loved the special dog treat bag they each received which is a thoughtful addition to the room package! We will be back :)"
"Hotel Red is a stylish and comfortable hotel in Madison, right near campus. It is the nicest hotel in the area and has all the amenities. There is off street parking. I only had a short stay, but I found the room very quiet and comfortable."
"We did a girls night there and it was our first time staying. The location is easy to find and great parking. Once we entered the hotel it felt like you were in someone's home. The front desk staff was so wonderful and helpful planning our night out. They leave no attention to detail unnoticed. We started our night out... More"
"As I mentioned previously we enjoyed our stay at Hotel Red. This has probably been our 10th time we have selected Hotel Red for our Madison lodging. Hotel Red offers a unique boutique hotel experience versus the mundane chain hotels."
"My sister and I stayed at the HotelRED while a family member was in a local hospital. We found the hotel to be an oasis in our otherwise very stressful days. The lobby, bar/restaurant areas are very well decorated, minimalist yet very inviting. Our upgraded suite was beautiful and exceptionally clean. The cement floors were a welcome feature as I... More"
"Great boutique hotel, great location. We were able to bring our dog so it was such a easy stay. Room was very large with a great balcony facing Camp Randell. Really nice restaurant for breakfast the next morning."
"This hotel is in a great location and very roomy. Many of the rooms have a patio where you can enjoy coffee in the morning or a cocktail in the afternoon. There is a nice bar and restaurant on site and walking RANDALL Statium is a cross the street."
"We hadn't been able to return to Gloucester for a few years, but we found the Atlantis to be just as well-kept and comfortable as we had years ago. Beautiful location and beautiful ocean views! The staff is friendly and helpful!"
"This year I went myself, over a blustery weekend in late June. In the past, we had stayed here many times. Outstanding view. Rooms are always in tip-top shape the same for all common spaces and grounds. Friendly, accommodating staff. A wonderful breakfast room, as well. You can count on the Atlantis."
"This place is truly beautiful! relaxing! and accommodating! Inn is very clean and neat. the rooms are all walk through. so you have a front door and a back door with a screen so you can sit and out back and look and out on the water. fresh chocolate chip cookies at the desk. friendly service! could not ask for...

"Absolutely beautiful Inn!! The beds were like sleeping on a cloud! Staff was wonderful! I'm dying to stay there again!!! Very close to the train, only minutes from Fenway Park, beautiful neighborhood!"
"We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full. We found this one, overpriced, but thought we had no choice. We positively hated it and moved to the all-new Motel 6 for the rest of our stay. It was cheaper, much newer and cleaner."
"My husband and I along with 2 other couples booked a night at the Lyttleton Inn for convenience purposes. We were going to a local music venue and live a little over an hour away. We decided to make a night of it and found The Lyttleton Inn. It was an unexpected surprise. A quaint New England Inn furnished with... More"
"Our room was charming with a comfortable bed and a small but perfectly adequate ensuite also, good wifi signal. The owner/host was welcoming/friendly and helpful without being intrusive and the breakfast provided the next morning was superb. Hiking trails are nearby or take a stroll around town. Would definitely stay here again. Tip: Before booking room, find out if it... More"
"Just came back from the Littleton Inn. My fianc and I are not usually BB type, but this place looked adorable, The inn was excellent Mary was great! Quaint little New England BB at it's best. Hoping to go back in the very near future. Not enough good things to say."
"Our family had an awesome experience here! Just incredibly clean and up to date suite. Loved the kitchenette. Very quiet and safe. Comfortable beds and a polite staff. Very affordable. Will come again!!"
"Great place to stay! They have everything you need for an extended stay or just one night. All the comforts of home. Good for a family or just by yourself. My son goes to college in Beverly,Mass and I have stayed at another hotel here, but this will be my go to for now on when I'm dropping him off... More"
"This hotel is fantastic! The staff is great and goes above and beyond for the guest. Extremely clean and the place looks brand new, the staff obviously takes a lot of pride. The only thing that is lacking is the breakfast but that's a given at most hotels."
"We stayed at this Best Western in mid-March and were pleasantly surprised at how nice it was for not being a high-end hotel. It is on a busy route and is not in a scenic spot, but it is handy to the highway to area attractions. Most importantly, it was neat and clean and looked like the decor had recently... More"
"They were very accommodating. We had a business meeting in Seattle, and we had to travel there with our toddler. The pack-n-play was already set up in the room when we got there. The internet was easy to connect and pain-free. The room was clean. Overall a very good experience."
"Room had wall paper and curtain falling down Plus blanket was dirty. Can deal with that but we had no heat and maintenence staff would not be back until the morning. Room was freezing cold. I have pictures if Expedia wants to see them. Remove this hotel from your listing please."
"We were on the road, and booked this right before midnight. Really the only hotel available at that time. Quaint hotel in an adorable town, but we had a truck with 18 foot trailer - no parking! We parked 3 blocks away on the street! No problems! The hotel has a few bars and there was defiantly some parting going on, but you could not hear it from our room! Hotel had elevator, but was not working at that time and we had to climb one big set of steps! Room was clean but 'old' and charming! Think we had a 'spirit' that messed with my night lite, but was 'friendly'! Nice breakfast in the AM - coffee was amazing! Food was nicely prepared and fresh! Desk clerk at midnight was very nice and accommodating (forgot his name!) sorry! Would love to come back to 'explore' this town and would defiantly stay here again!"
"Wow I should have listened to the other reviews. We just needed a place to stay for one night and we thought we would give this place a chance after hearing it was recently remodeled. The smell when you walked in the halls was horrible and dirty smelling. It became even worse when we entered our room. The bathroom smelled... More"
"This hotel was clean and comfortable- my two biggest priorities for a hotel. The staff was courteous and went out of their way to accommodate our needs during the stay. We had a family crisis that necessitated leaving two days into a five day stay, and they were very understanding and supportive. The breakfast bar was beyond a continental muffins... More"
"Staff was friendly and helpful. Wonderful continental breakfast. Rooms were very clean, the bedding seemed new and really comfortable mattresses. The hotel is conveniently located to all Bethlehem attractions and extremely easy to find from I78."
"My wife and I have stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years. The staff is always friendly (like family), the rooms are exceptionally clean and comfortable. Breakfast is one of the best offered at any of the hotel/motels that we have stayed at. I plan to visit again in the near future and will make it... More"
"Get the 'King Leisure room. Spacious enough for couples to have their own space many have two TV's, fridges and microwaves. Some are even suites. Undergoing renovations and we had a new room and it was excellent. Staff is outstanding. The only shortcoming worth mentioning is breakfast but, at 6:30 AM who cares - coffee is great and who can...

"This place defies the image of most chain hotels by offering immaculate facilities, attention to detail, friendly staff and a genuinely welcoming vibe. For anyone visiting the Lehigh Valley with a focus on Bethlehem and its environs, whether for business or pleasure, the Holiday Inn Express Hotel Suites Bethlehem offers easy-on, easy-off accessibility to Route 78 and is a...

"This was just a terrible experience from check-in to check-out. When you arrive, there is only one person on the property. Get to the room and there is a leak, the microwave does not work and the bathroom is dirty. When they changed our rooms, it was a little better, but no refrigerator (I have four children, no refrigerator is... More"
"Very well priced hotel convenient to major highways while being in a very pleasant suburb in the Summit/Chatham/Morristown area. Direct train service to NYC. Decor is dated but it's clean and safe. If you need an upscale experience this isn't it. If, however, you want all the benefits of a good hotel in this area at a reasonable cost -... More"
"My wife and I have stayed at this BW a number of times and have always been completely satisfied with it. The people who manage it are very nice and helpful, as are other staff members, and we've never had a problem with noise (but we always get a room on the non-freeway side). It is tucked away in a... More"
"We made reservations a day prior to arrival, they put us in the room right next to the office. When we arrived, around 8:00 pm, after being on the road all day we expected at least a decent room to crash for the night. The bathtub faucet was leaking and the tub had at least two inches of water in... More"
"I admit to being apprehensive, as renting sight unseen can be a challenge. We stayed in the OK Corral over New Years. The cabin was exquisite. It is a newer cabin, with everything one could need and more. Kitchen necessities for the 9 of us, but definitely could have accommodated more. Acceptable to nice quality linens on the beds and... More"
"Convenient location. One exit away from many restaurants. The staff was very attentive to address any issues. The lobby and breakfast area was very nice and inviting. Beds were extremely cosy and there are rooms that connect for big families."
"I really enjoyed myself. Great atmosphere, the food was delicious. Bar tender was on point. The patio was so relaxing. I'm planning my get away weekend there. Over all 10.

"Beautiful hotel warm and inviting plus breakfast to order in the morning. I would definitely stay here again."
"I want top notch service when I travel or go out on the town. This place fulfill that on all levels Good food and fun bar. Rooms relaxing and clean. Staff makes the stay perfect. Stacey the gm went above and beyond made recommendations for restaurants and even reservations! This is a gem of a place."
"Really enjoyed my stay at the Aloft in downtown Durham. The property has an excellent location, nice amenities (consistent with Aloft brand), and a very friendly, helpful staff. Rooms were the highlight. New, clean, and comfortable. Some noise with adjacent construction and nearby rail line, but not a major nuisance. Park is 10, but only available in top four floor... More"
"Located right beside Asheville Outlet Mall. A big plus for my wife and daughter. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Always smiled and greeted us when we entered. This will be our first choice for a hotel for all our future visits to Asheville. Five to ten minutes from downtown."
"Great stay. Desk clerk was no nice and helpful. Great beds. Clean room. Location location location!!!"
"unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less"
"Needed a place close to Middlebourne, WV for one night and didn't want to spend a lot for just a place to sleep. Had never used the so called lower end Wyndham hotels, but decided to give it a try.

"The Hotel is Very Clean, the suite was very clean, modern. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The free breakfast was awesome as well. I would definitely suggest you give this hotel a chance. I will definitely stay here again!"
"We stayed 1 night in a smoker room, we don't smoke but this was the only option I could select. The room was pretty dated but still seemed clean. Outaide stairs to get up to our room were a little rickety. Pool/game room area was very neat! Breakfast was good. Staff very polite and friendly. They even gave us a little bag with a few treats and bottle water when we arrived so that was nice too! Would stay there again."
"We had a great time. When I booked the Hotel I booked it for the inside pool for Spring Break for my grandchildren. I didn't even realize all the other perks of this hotel for kids. Inside pool, inside playground, inside game room and mini golf. I would totally stay here again for kids it was great."
"This property does not look bad from out front, but room 118 is the worst I have ever seen anywhere. The dead bolt would not lock. The door chain was not secure. The bathroom door was rotten and could not close. A large hole in the wall beside the bathtub where perhaps a soap dish was supposed to be was... More"

It was very impressed with the location and service. couple blocks away from cable car and shopping places. we've had city walk through out the city. it was fun doing that with friends, taking pictures, chitchatting, and eating. but afterward we were super tired. After a long day, i stopped at the bar for... More"
"The folks at the concierge desk are very helpful in directing you on where to go, what to do, and how to get there. The hotel is within walking distance of Chinatown. The tub in the junior suite is large and oh-so-nice after spending the day shopping or walking the wharf!"
"The agent reserving our San Francisco hotel had messed up and our first choice hotel was now full.

"I stay here every chance I get. It is my hotel of choice in San Francisco. The service is always superb and the rooms are amazing. I have pretty high standard when it comes to hotel beds and the InterContinental more than lived up to them. I would recommend it to anyone."
"This is one of my all time favorite hotels. I know it may sound absurd, but one reason I look forward to visiting SF is to stay here! The hotel staff is great, friendly and super competent. The rooms are modern with very comfortable beds. The lobby and bar area are modern and elegant. Despite the number of floors and... More"

"We could not have been more impressed with the service, the friendliness, the cleanliness, and the location of the hotel. It is an absolutely stunning hotel right around the corner from Union Square and the Financial District. The staff was very welcoming. We loved the turn-down service and our view from the corner King room on Floor 24 was absolutely... More"
"I highly recommend this hotel! I wanted a modern hotel that didn't look like most of the San Fransisco historic hotels. PROS: Clean. Beautiful. Great views. Perfect location. Friendly Staff. Affordable prices. Floor to ceiling windows! Bathtub. CONS: I couldn't find any cons!"
"Stayed here after doing the Escape from Alcatraz triathlon. just loved it. Had a good massage and the restaurant was just an absolute delight.

A special word of thanks to the concierge desk who were interested, helpful in recommending restaurant, shopping sightseeing options, especially Nelson. The room was great, the location... More"
"This is an excellent hotel. Not perfect - not amazing, but certainly excellent. I usually frequent Westin Hotels and this one is like a Westin, but nicer. It's certainly worthy of its 4 star rating. The location is good depending on your plans. If you want to do the tourist activities, you're far from the hilly streets, trolley line, wharf,... More"
"La habitacion ligeramente reducida. Falto mobiliario para desempacar y empacar maletas. por lo demas excelente. muy recomendable"
"Awesome! We had a wonderful time. The hotel have a amazing breakfast every morning! Definitely will stay again."
"Loved our visit. Would definitely room here again in the future."
"I had an overnight stay and I found everything fine."
"Great hotel close to BWI Airport. Unexpectedly pleasant stay. Ruby friendly and informative staff. Great Italian restaurant with a short walking distance. Very short shuttle to airport. WILL Absolutely Come again"
"Easily accessible to highways shopping. Since I've stayed in this area before I will definitely stay here again."
"Nice place to spend the night. Very close to car rental."
"This hotel was cheaper than the other near-BWI hotels that were available when I needed one. Yet, a bit to my surprise, it was a really nice place. The only small negative is there is only one computer and printer for printing boarding passes."
"Stayed here after getting in on a very late flight. Quick check-in, clean room, nice complimentary breakfast."
"This is a great location for turning in your rental car."
"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me."
"Very comfortable, we enjoyed our stay."
"Hotel was great. Provided shuttle service to rental car facility and airport even though was very early in the morning"
"I took a birthday trip with my family, and everything was perfect. I'm so glad I was able to find such a nice room at such a late notice."
"I can't think of anything I would have changed. JoAnn, the person at the desk, was amazing--managed to juggle phone calls and a line of people with courtesy and grace. The accessibility to Annapolis, rates, and cleanliness were outstanding. We'll definitely be back!"
"I was really impressed with my stay! It was nice and clean. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was good! I would say yes I t is well worth it!"
"They Hyatt Regency in Sacramento has great customer service and is very nice. It's within walking distance to the Convention Center and a lot of great restaurants."
"2 weeks prior to Christmas until now, my unfortunate situation caused me to have to stay this Marriott for a month. I must say that I have had the best of care this hotel. All staff members have a wonderful attitude from room service to the GM. I actually was accommodated for everything I needed. I even looked... More"
"We stayed at the Drury Inn Suites for a conference that was held at The Dome at America's Center. It was a great location for our conference! Free parking, free breakfast, free dinner, free (3) drinks. We did eat some food there and it was cooked properly. Not fancy, but if you are on a budget, it would definitely... More"
"This was our second stay at a Drury Hotel and we were impressed once again! The rooms were clean and fair sized, check in was easy and quick. The free drinks and evening snack are such a great feature and you could honestly make a meal of it. The pool is close to the food/beverage area so it is convenient... More"
"Hotel was really nice. Loved the free parking and breakfast. Awesome location since it is within walking distance to the arch and stadium. Would stay again. Nice pool area. Front desk very helpful. They offered a veterans disxount."
"We drove 17 hours that day and I just wanted to shower and sleep. I am so glad they open this newer hotel in Deming. Breakfast was pretty good but the rooms were great. We will be back next time we come through NM."
"The location was great. It was my first time stay at a hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room was fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay here. Thank you to the staff for making my stay enjoyable"
"Good value for a clean, quiet, comfortable room. Easy to get to just off of I35 and 1 1/2 miles form I90. Good free continental breakfast and Kim, who takes care of the breakfast area does a great job of keeping the area clean and well stocked."
"Our room was spacious enough for 4. Even with our very late arrival, the front desk person was friendly and gave us a good room. The breakfast was the best so far on the trip, with cold and hot options, like scrambled eggs and sausage. A nice find along the way."
"Got this hotel because of proximity to water park next door, booked kind of late so had to get a king suite. Room was great and spacious, had a king bed and a small pull out couch. Bathroom and room were clean and liked that it had a microwave and a small fridge in room. Only had a shower, which... More"
"Great staff and accommodations for our family with young kids. The evening snack hour (food and drinks ) was perfect to complement our time in Dayton. Pool was fun for the kids, even in December. Recommended"
"We will be back! Food and drink free... Wonderfully accommodating staff especially Asia :). Free dinner, drinks, and hot breakfast! Seriously huge rooms! Room for 6 easily! We will try to stay at all the Drury Inns! Wahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"
"This hotel is clean, fresh, updated and welcoming. The room was spacious, clean and current. Everything worked well in the room, bed was comfy. A breakfast is included and was very good. The staff are all helpful and willing to go the extra mile. Will definitely be staying here again. One of the best hotels in this price range I... More"
"What can I say but there is no other choice when staying in the area. Kristi made the stay happen before even checking in. A simple call and boom, a better room. The pool, hot tub a relaxing pleasure. The evening snacks are always a treat, the breakfast cannot be beat. So quiet and so COMFORTABLE. See you when pass... More"
"Love this place! Great service, rooms and amenities. Can't beat the price and all the free food you get! I highly recommend to anyone. Free hot breakfast Buffett, free kick back dinner, and free popcorn/pop till 10:00pm. Very nice indoor/outdoor pool. The staff checks on all the guest in the dinning area to see if you need anything. Need I... More"
"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up."
"Good Hotel, spent two nights at this hotel in Fayetteville nc. The check in process was a breeze . The nice lady at check in was very nice . She explained the charges and breakfast times . 6am 9am .. They also offer Fresh baked cookies 7pm .. the room was nice they have done major updates ( sorry no... More"
"Stayed here for an overnight on way home. Susan at front desk was friendly and accomodating during checkin. Room, pillows, bed, wi-fi was very good. Arrived and departed in darkness therefore cannot comment on surrounding properties. Morning breakfast was typical, grab and go. I did not use any other facilities or dine at nearby establishments."
"My friend and I stayed here last Friday (2 July). First off, we were told the public facilities were unavailable due to work being done in the hall (wallpaper going up). We were assigned our room and it was 1 bed. So went back down and said it was supposed to be 2 beds. We were issued another room (318)... More"
"Noisy"
"Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong"
"breakfast was bad, room not clean and in need of repair, unprofessional appearance of staff, Dirty linins."
"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke."
"The hotel staff went above and beyond."
"Nice and well kept, close to bike trails and dining"
"The room was very comfortable. We used the pool every night, the lifeguard was professional and active. Loved the fact that the Metro was less than a half mile walk, we walked there every day for the trip into D.C. Many shops within walking distance of the hotel, also movie theaters. Breakfast buffet was good, large assortment of foods."
"Beautiful hotel. Rooms clean. Pool very nice. Restaurant in hotel was excellent- food and mix drinks delicious. Only critique would be needing to ask for more than 2 towels (in a room we checked in with 4 ppl)."
"We had a very pleasant 3 day stay. Would stay here next time my family and I are in town."
"It was a great experience I would recommend them to anyone"
"Great stay in Silver Springs for the price................"
"The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers."
"Stayed in the 2 room king suite. It was perfect. Loved the separate living room. Nice and clean and comfy bed. This hotel has room service and they took care of us very well. The valet were awesome and fast."
"very pleasant staff"
"It was my first visit to the area and It was close to all areas I visited. It was Close to shops, restaurants and in walking distance to Whole Foods. There was also a very nice restaurant MRS K's TOLLHOUSE nearby."
"The service was friendly, helpful and outgoing. The room was clean and beds comfy. Walls a little on the thin side and no mini fridge was our only complaint along with an aggressive shower head. Yes I would return to this hotel. The food was good and the people who worked their were outstanding."
"ONLY HAS VALET PARKING WHICH IS A PAIN AS ON 1 TIME THEY HAD A LOT IS FULL SIGN OUT FRONT, SO HAD TO PARK IN A PUBLIC LOT 2 BLOCKS AWAY. ALSO 1 DAY WE DID NOT GET OUR NEWSPAPER--THEY RAN OUT AND TOLD ME I COULD WALK 3 BLOCKS AND BUY ONE. MY WIFE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE, IT NEVER CAME SO SHE CALLED AND IT WAS READY, NO ONE HAD BOTHERED TO BRING IT UP. THE FIRST DAY, HAD TO GET MAINTENANCE TO ROOM TO SHOW ME HOW TO TURN ON LIVING ROOM LIGHTS. ALL SORTS OR TRICKS NEEDED. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE ROOM WAS CLEAN , SUPER BED TO SLEEP IN AND THE STAFF WAS REALLY NICE AND FRIENDLY."
"Nicely situated in downtown Silver Spring within walking distance of the revitalized shopping/restaurant district. We seemed locked in to the Valet Parking which was not terrible at 15 for a weekend day. Our 6th-floor ice maker was not working so we had to get ice from one of the other floors...not a big deal, either."
"My family and i enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and comfy. The staff was very professional and polite. Breakfast was delicious."
"Very well positioned hotel, everything is close by"
"Stay was great and nice friendly staff."
"Started with front desk people getting me into my room early...excellent. Received my hot, chocolate chip cookie upon check-in...perfect. Spot was about 3 blocks from the METRO station...plus. Staff was really attentive and helpful."
"We chose this Best Western because it offered up to 3 weeks free parking with Park-sleep-fly. No other park-sleep-fly option comes close to the hospitality and comfort of this hotel. It is outstanding. The front desk manager was incredibly helpful and courteous and upgraded us to a suite. Upon the recommendation of the front desk staff, we enjoyed an excellent... More"
"Had a great stay! The hotel staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, especially Sami and Matt. Thank you so much!"
"The room was very clean and bathroom was spacious and luxurious. We are very satisfied staying here."
"Very nice!"
"Came to town to bury my father in law in family plot. We had a total of seven people in three double rooms-we were all very comfortable. Breakfast was very good, hotel employees courteous and helpful. Only negative was the bathrooms were small. But, they were clean. Overall, value was great, room was clean, and we were in a safe part of town. We were on the highway side, which was a little noisy, but I had my earplugs. No one else was bothered by the noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not backed up to the highway. Hotel was great with accommodating all of our requests."
"Very clean and comfortable property. Has everything you need for business and pleasure. Great amenities for the traveler. Before and after work buffet is very accommodating and enjoyable. Staff is Top Notch !!! Very friendly and attentive to the guest needs. Will be my CdA Home Away from Home !!!"
"Great location - very close to the freeway and conveniently located to the restaurants. we had a big family room on the first floor-- 2 queen beds, very nice bathroom and big closet! I will request for this room again when we are back to Coeur d'Alene. Their breakfast is great too. Staff service is excellent."
"We've stayed at the SpringHill Suites several times over the past year. Most importantly to me the property is clean. In addition, the staff (especially Heather at the front desk) is helpful and always smiling. We had a few issues during our stay room cleaning was overlooked and no bottled water in our room. With a quick call to the... More"
"Excelente! Fui por 8 dias y 7 noches. Un servicio muy bueno, los desayunos calientes, limpieza del cuarto excelente y todos los dias realizaban limpiezas en los cuartos. Cerca de centros comerciales y frente al hotel la parada del autobus y te lleva hasta el downtown de Baltimore. Y a la estacion del tren. Lo recomiendo, muy buenos precios."
"I recently stayed at the Days Inn in Glen Burnie and I really appreciated its location in relationship to the airport (BWI) and shopping malls, which was the intent of my trip. The staff was great the facility was above my expectation and I would recommend this hotel to anyone just looking for a place to lay your head."
"Would stay there again."
"I was beside the steps and people was up and down those stairs all night and early in the morning. I really didn't get my proper rest that I needed. And they were so loud."
"Came down for Valentine's day for a little vacation and enjoyed every second. Bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and big for our 4 night stay."
"I will not be using expedia ever again this Hotel was a dump and if this is what you guys deal with I don't want any part of it. I didn't stay I just lost my money because there was no refund so they said. so thanks for nothing."
"Everything was 5 star! Beautiful granite, exceptional bed and a quiet night."
"I'm very happy with that particular hotel! The room was very neat and clean, staff very friendly and willing to help in anyway possible. The frontdesk employee gets 10 out of 10 points for friendliness and service. It's convinient location will suit anyone nomatter if you're travelling for business or for pleasure. I would highly recommend Days Inn Glen Burnie to everyone who is looking to stretch their vacation dollar and yet have fun and comfort of a higher class hotel!"
"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous."
"Made a mistake and walked on the carpet with barefeet,, umm flypaper, not quite. Unchanged sheets on 1 of the beds. Poorly cleaned bathroom. Felt dirty till i got home and showered."
"The worst hotel stay I've ever had. On the positive side there was a hiphop chicken and fish next door..."
"Great Stay! Staff was very helpful!"
"Nice staff, good breakfast available. Rooms were nice and clean."
"The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night. Spend a few extra dollars and find another place down the road."
"Great room, breakfast . . . easy access to everything we were up to while visiting our children!"
"I had a room reserved for me by the National Guard for july 15th and 16th. About 5:30 is when i showed up to the hotel on the evening of the 15th. I told the lady at the front desk that i had this reservation for tonight and that the national guard was the ones who had set it up... More"
"Your standard Holiday Inn hotel. Wish the chain would remove some of the gimmicks and drop the price, but I get some people enjoy them. It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault."
"First, this place is super quaint and cute. Some of my biggest takeaways were: - Location was great, considering we had our 10 month old baby girl with us. No one treated us differently because we were there as a family. - Rooms were a little dim for me, but they were clean and decorated very nicely. - Loved the... More"
"Excellent little hotel in a wonderful location with corteous and helpful staff in a very well kept facility. Stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it. Rita, a member of the staff, was particularly helpful."
"Very clean and pleasant hotel. The noise level almost non existing, always a plus for me! The staff was very professional and catered to my needs without question. The banquet hall was very clean, a great size, well put together, and affordable. I will definitely be doing business with this location again. Thank you for providing me with a home... More"
"Very large room, restaraunts close to the hotel, room had everything needed, enough room for a family of 5 to be comfortable. Close to BWI and not far from Inner-Harbor, on time and courteous shuttle driver. Our family will return."
"Up to date hotel, consider carrying Starbucks coffee in the rooms, access to the business center was a plus and you had working printers too great amenity. I would stay here again"
"I enjoyed my recent stay and will stay here again next month when I return on business. I was especially pleased with the helpful front desk staff as well as the restaurant team. The breakfast each day was quite good as well."
"Well maintained facilities, courteous staff, as you expect in the Hilton chain. close proximity to BWI airport great weekend rate, at least that weekend."
"staff most helpful. was able to check in much earlier and got room on top floor as requested. business room well equiped/"
"Service was excellent"
"We attained this hotel at a great price. The room was comfortable and conveniently located. The gym and pool was a definate plus. We would choose this hotel again."
"One of the best hotels I stayed. A++"
"It was lovely and relaxing. I will come again! Thanks"
"I finally found my go to hotel near BWI airport. I travel a lot through that airport and after bumming around I finally found the one!! Very clean hotel with the utmost courteous staff!"
"This was a nive hotel. The bed was very confortable. the rooms were very clean, and it was nice that they had a wall thermostat to better regulate the rooms temperature. the HVAC was quiet and the staff was very helpful. The box spring was a bit worn though. I had use some pillows under the mattress to stop the feling of sleeping up side down. other than that it was a great stay"
"This is a very nice place wit easy access to restaurants and the airport."
"The hotel was enjoyable, and everything was clean, and more than we expected.The pool was nice, plenty of towels, and a Life guard on duty. The rooms were clean, and the servic was excellent."
"My family stayed overnite, the staff was friendly and very helpful, large cleen room."
"Excellent Hotel overall,great location,friendly staff,comfortable beds,Free internet"
"Outstanding Hotel. After spending the day at Inner Harbor, we spent the night at BWI's Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very friendly and helped us find a good place to eat. The rooms were very comfortable and very clean. The whole hotel, itself, was very well maintained."
"Everything was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. They had no problem giving us a late checkout when we needed it. Overall great experience."
"Everything was great. Breakfast was particularly yummy with made to order omelettes. Only room for improvement is to increase number of luggage carts available in the lobby."
"I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great."
"Great"
"Very nice hotel, only complaint was that the pool is very small so if two families are in the pool it's overcrowded, but would definetly stay again."
"My stay was very short with actually only being a night sleep and catch an early flight however the room was clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful."
"We only had 2 wash rags and there were 3 occupants. The faucet on the shower was loose, so we had to be careful. The room itself was clean and was very cozy, especially since I was traveling with 2 small children. We will definitely stay there again."
"Nice Room with good size flat screen TV. Resturant pricey and limited menu, food was good."
"Clean, comfortable and quiet room, convenient shuttle to airport, AND they let me leave my car in their lot while I traveled. Good price, too. Perfect."
"From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!"
"Hotelxcellent H"
"Excellent location - clean hotel - safe - friendly and helpful staff. We ve stayed twice this year - short driving distance to Disney parks. Great for family travel - breakfast and wifi included. Will stay again"
"Very nice hotel. Rooms are quite comfortable. Donna at the front desk was super helpful and suggested many nearby restaurants. Hotel is centrally located. Lobby has a nice bar too. Will plan to come back.Greetings, Thank you for staying with us here at the L.A. Hotel Downtown. So happy to hear that we exceeded your expectations in every way during your stay. Can't wait to see you back with us.. Best Regards, The L.A. Hotel Downtown"
"Great place to stay for the price. Newly remodeled and well maintained. Closeness to interstate is very good. Easy access with plenty of places to eat and shop. Quaint small town. Felt very safe staing there"
"Everyone there is very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Hidden behind Holiday Inn, it's very much worth the stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time we have used this hotel and will continue to. Never had a problem here and continental breakfast offers a huge variety."
"This hotel is an easy on / off from the freeway. The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. During both of our stays, we were the only ones using the pool and that was a bonus. The breakfast bar impressed us with the variety of options available. Definitely recommend this hotel!"
"Never again! The rooms comforters were stained terribly and found hair on sheets. They gave us another room and it looked the same. You get what you pay for I guess. We left and drove to another hotel"
"It was great room was very nice n they treated me like a vip"
"The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here."
"Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever."
"Needs Improvement,Our room had a odor, the toliet leak, the room was not clean that well."
"I would sleeep on the street rather than this Motel."
"Perfect for a family of four on Chincoteague. Clean, friendly, well-appointed, convenient to everything. A no-hassle getaway for a holiday weekend."
"What a pleasant surprise. All rooms have a great view and are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel is a real value."
"Close to the park and to the downtown, we were very pleased, definitely would stay again"
"Wonderful staff, clean hotel, great location!"
"The Comfort Suite in chincoteague, VA had a sumptuous breakfast, with hot and cold choices, even fresh waffles daily. The room was large and comfortable, the housekeeping staff very on top of their work, and the front desk accomodating and available. The location is perfect - near enough to walk to the shops, near enough to Assateague for a quick beach drive. Lovely for children."
"Great, friendly service. Close to beach and great restaurants and art galleries. Comfortable room. We had a great time."
"Everything was wonderful, down to the sign, the balloons and chocolate bar in the room for the 2 birthdays we were celebrating. Great view of the Chincoteague channel, room was clean, staff was very courteous, breakfast buffet was extremely scrumptious. Overall very excellent stay in the middle of November!!"
"The hotel is almost completely renovated. All rooms have bay view and no smoking. Room was comfortable with separate seating area and table/chairs. Like the idea of going green by requesting that visitors opt not to have sheets/towels changed everday. Will definitely return."
"This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!"
"Bad: Rooms are a bit small and food is mediocre. Good: Atmosphere overall was chill. Great after busy workday."
"Bad: Need higher wattage light bulbs in bedside lamps. Larger pillows for bed. Good: Like the character of the hotel. Unique. Nostalgic. Bars and restaurant are fun. Friendly staff. Good food. Reasonable prices."
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Pool, food/bars, enormous room, large bath room, gardens, staff"
"Bad: Pool crowded with local moms tots. Would love common gathering room, all designated common space is also used for meetings and were booked while we were there. Good: Charming, quiet, clean- friendly staff! Fun happy hours at tiny corner bars. Beautiful courtyard garden. Large fire pit out front."
"Our hotel staff recommended we check it out for the view and brew and we just loved it! Such a cool idea to re-use a character filled building! There's a little something for everyone there...we checked out a new movie for only 3 and enjoyed drinks and food while relaxing in comfy couches. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere...

"I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this hotel and the staff that keeps it running impeccably! I travel often for business and I was absolutely blown away by the wonderful customer service I received at this particular location. I have stayed twice, booked a third stay and look forward to it every single time. I went as far... More"
"Excellent accommodations, excellent staff, super super breakfast in the morning, with everything you can imagine. Stay at this hotel you will be happy! Easy access to the highway, easy access to many venues. Very clean, the staff was very welcoming when I arrived!"
"We were pleasantly surprised with the Hilton Garden Inn. When we arrived, we thought it must be very new, rather than 8 years old, because everything was so clean and fresh. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. The service was excellent- the front desk clerk called just after check in to ensure that our room met expectations and the one... More"
"When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one."
"It had roaches... Roaches."
"Great location . The employees are always eager to help and truly seem sincere! they have an excellent breakfast area, My room was very clean, and Air conditioner really worked great. I would come back for a stay for sure!"
"This was our first trip to Hawaii and we spend several months planning. It will be easier next time because we plan to come back to this resort on our next trip. No complaints whatsoever. We were fortunate to arrive shortly after the main pool reopened. I can imagine that would have put a serious crimp on things. With all... More"
"Seriously where do I begin. Absolutely hands down amazing. I am so happy we stayed at this resort. The pools, the food, the service.... they were the best. Im telling you, if you want to enjoy your vacation stay here. We had the best trip, we loved our suite. The hotel is so clean, the food was so good, they... More"
"We stayed here in July for half of our Maui stay. We have been to Maui several times and this was our favorite place we've stayed so far. We booked through Chasing Rainbows and after reading reviews were a little concerned since we would not be able to get service from the resort staff. However, everyone was great. We had... More"
"Even though this resort was highly recommended by our travel agent, we had no idea it was going to be such a joy to stay there. This was our first trip to Hawaii as a family, and our three teenaged daughters (ages 19, 16, and 13) absolutely loved it. Even though it did seem there were a lot of younger... More"
"I was truly impressed by the resort Would come back again in a heart beat Stayed in a 2 bedroom 2 bath condo in the Konea Building. Amazing beach waterfront. Enjoyed Duke's Restaurant on a numbe of occations."
"The Honua Kai is the newest resort in the Ka'anapali area. The place was nice and clean and very comfortable. We've stayed in several resorts in the Ka'anapali area and the Honua Kai is a very nice resort and well located with quick easy access from the main road and closeness to the beach. The beach area is nice and... More"
"We just came back from our vacation and I can say that we want to go back already. Honua Kai resort is really great and well maintained. We didn't have any bad things to say about our stay and can only think of great experience there. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful - from valet to front desk to... More"
"My wife and 2 boys loved the room. 2 Bedroom suite was perfect for us and the view is unbeatable. The first day we checked in we went to the pool and immediate greeted by Josh at the pool. He was very nice and extremely helpful. He got us all set up with towels, snorkel gear, and cabana for the... More"
"We went to Maui for our Honeymoon for 10 days in October. We booked the first 5 nights at the Honua Kai and the last 5 at the Hyatt. We wish we would have stayed all 5 at the Honua Kai. This resort far surpasses any of the hotel/resorts we saw and stayed at. We were greeted with friendly helpful... More"
"I am finally getting around to writing this review after staying last year. This resort is AMAZING - we had such a great time and were very sorry to leave. The rooms are wonderful, we had a one bedroom suite facing the back (get ocean front if you can afford it). The resort is pristine with beautiful flowers boardering the... More"
"We rented a partial ocean view unit here through VRBO for our honeymoon and loved it. I read a lot of reviews about the amount of children at the resort, and there are a lot of families, however there are a lot of children and families everywhere on Maui so this did not bother us at all. The resort grounds... More"
"Travelled with family of 4 (children 9 5). Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with partial ocean view. The apartments are very spacious and well appointed. After seeing other reviews on this web site regarding privately owned apartments, I actually rented our apartment through a separate web site to the resort itself. This web site has numerous privately owned... More"
"Beautiful resort, fantastic room. Staff was unbelievably great. No expense spared at this resort. Won't be able to return soon enough. If you go to Maui this is the place to stay."
"We stayed in the 3 bedroom suite and it was gorgeous. We were on the second floor in the first tower overlooking the pools and the ocean. It was beyond my expectations. The kitchen is brand new and beautiful and they have it stocked with mostly every utensil and kitchen aid you would need. The hotel also supplies you with... More"
"Arrived in the middle of the week for a 6 night stay. Upon arrival, the location was gorgeous. The open air check in lobby set the tone for the vacation. The bellman very helpful, fast, and had everything he needed for the job. We rented a two bedroom, 2 bathroom villa from the hotel and we had no problems. The... More"
"Since I'm a travel agency owner I travel a lot. This resort (luxury brand new condo) is pricey but worths every dollar you spent. Amazing snorkeling with lot of fishes and HUGE turtles are guaranteed The grounds are so beatiful and well kept. Lot of pools and barbeque places. Giant supermarket TIMES right across the road. Rooms are brand... More"
"First time I've ever stayed here and definitely not the last. We have always stayed at the Whaler, but this time were looking for a condo with better ammenities that was more appealing to our your children. Honua Kai is the perfect mix. It is a privately owned condo with a resort feel. The grounds are amazing The board walk... More"
"We recently spent eight days at Honua Kai, Konea Tower studio/ocean view on the 8th floor. The grounds are immaculate and staff was friendly and helpful. We've never stayed in a condo for vacation before but found our stay to be the best of both a full service hotel and the convenience of a condo. Our kids loved the pools... More"
"We just returned from one week at the Honua Kai and would go back again. The resort was beautiful. We were initially in a one bedroom mountain view room . We arrived late at night so I did not get the full effect of the room until the next morning and I was not happy with the road noise that... More"
"We rented a condo through an agency and had the most amazing week staying here. Our suite was top notch, just perfect. The grounds are stunning and all the staff were super helpful with anything we needed. Was handy to have Duke's on-site too. The kiddies pool can get a bit rowdy but there are other pools to choose from... More"
"We returned to HK for our 4th year and tried this unit. It was on the other side of the property but still with an internal view. The unit was done in the same way as the others (furniture, TVs, kitchen and layout) with 1 exception. The owners had replaced the main area carpet with tiles. This was great for... More"
"We are nearing the end of our 9-night stay at Honua Kai and it has been TERRIFIC. We have met many west coast folks who come every summer as repeat visitors and if we didn't have the long trip from the east coast, we could easily join that group. GROUNDS Stunning. Immaculately maintained. You go out in the morning and... More"
"We stayed in 719 rented thru VRBO. The unit was perfect, seemed brand new and had all the extras you could need - hair dryer, beach chairs, aloe for your sunburn, etc. Resort and pools were busy because it was Easter week, but we always managed to find a spot. Loved having a condo so we could enjoy breakfast relaxing... More"
"We booked this hotel through VRBO website ten days for 3 of us. It was enjoyable experience. Parking lot right in the front of the main entrance but we used underground one. It has easier access to the elevator and don't need to worry about rain or heat. The room was nice with separate bedroom and well appointed with all... More"
"We have a family vacation to Maui every year and have stayed at numerous places. I am very pleased to say I finally found a place that I will re-book over and over again. There is no need to look any further for us. The condo (unit 206 at the Hokulani) is everything and more of what was described in... More"
"We really loved this place. It's beautiful. The grounds look great. The rooms are spacious and very well kept. We would definitely stay again. We had a three bedroom unit, and they were all wonderful."
"It is rare that a property can fulfill all my travel fantasies...but the Honua Kai delivered even beyond my high expectations. A friend recommended we try this property over a big brand we usually go with and we were pleasantly surprised. From the moment we arrived, the valet service was quick to welcome and assist us...they had a list of... More"
"Great view, great pools, my girlfriend loved the full kitchen and the washer and dryer.. lots of families but the adult pool was quiet. Beach area was nice also . Loved our stay!!!! Comfy bed and the air worked great. The balcony was huge with a table and chairs. Fully equipted kitched with utensiles and glassware. Even a martini shaker... More"
"We had another excellent vacation at Honua Kai. I looked around at the competitors - Westin / Sheraton / Marriott, but renting a Honua Kai condo through VRBO is still a considerable savings. It's a little further away from the action around Whalers' Village but we really didn't want to spend much time doing that anyways. There is a shuttle... More"
"We stayed at Konea tower facing the beach. The amenities provided by this resort was great from full kitchen, Bosch dishwasher, washer and dryer furnished with detergent everyday. Great for couples and especially families. The concierge service was excellent as well, helped us planned our first trip to Maui. We will return."
"The resort was one of the most gorgeous places I have ever stayed at. Everything about the place was top-notch. The room was beautiful and equipped with everything you would need in the full kitchen and bath. The room opened up to a large balcony where we could eat our meals. We were given a gift basket with laundry detergent... More"
"Stayed in 2/2 with ocean view. Spacious with full kitchen. Balcony is quite ample with doors that open the whole thing up A fave feature. Comfy bed sheets. Very good and friendly staff. Great snorkeling reef out front (bring reef shoes). How can you miss with Dukes on premise Everything we had there was excellent. Very nearby market and... More"
"We got an awesome price for our room. When we arrived the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room is spacious, clean, and has everything you could possibly need. The pools are great and your so close to the beach."
"Three generations traveled to this paradise with great expectations. We were not disappointed! This is a lovely, well kept resort. We stayed on the fourth floor in the middle of the U shaped building and enjoyed a breathtaking view of the sea. The nana doors of the Lanai and also the doors of the Master bedroom opened up accordion style... More"
"Two families shared a two bedroom two bathroom condo and didn't feel crowded at all. Plenty of space in the living and dining area, with extra space on the balcony too. The kids loved the swimming pool with slide, and we had a nice lunch by the pool, and dinner at the Dukes. Lovely holiday resort! Only slight downside was... More"
"Went here with the family in June of 2011. It's a beautiful hotel with lots of nice touches in the rooms: AC, ceiling fans, glass accordion doors that open to the lanai, full kitchen and washer/dryer. The kids enjoyed swimming in many pools and the great snorkeling on the beach. We chose a mountain view room to save on costs... More"
"My wife fell in love with this resort the moment she entered the room. The view was gorgeous and the resort was kid friendly. The kitchen was nice and clean so was the laundry room. We wished we could stay longer than we planed."
"Awesome resort! We are always pleased with the staff and the rooms. One of the best resort beaches in Lahaina. Great beach entry for kids and the pool has plenty to keep the kids happy. We have stayed at this resort 4 times and will continue in the future."
"It was our first time staying at the Honua Kai...We were there for a week....I had my girlfriend and her 84 yo blind grandmother with me...We stayed in a 2 bedroom/bathroom suite (147) on the bottom floor...The suite was well stocked and had high end Bosch Appliances....Be aware that full housekeeping is only every 4th day and trash and towels... More"
"We stayed in a 4 bedroom condo with spectacular ocean views! The resort was clean and very welcoming! We were celebrating my youngest sister's monumental 40th Birthday and the concierge helped us organize to have a local company deliver a gourmet cake and gorgeous lei prior to our arrival. The staff was absolutely amazing! The pools were clean and very... More"
"This is our second time in Maui. Honua Kai is a relatively new hotel/resort. Our reservation is thru AAA travel agency, We had a one bedroom suite ocean view. Resort: Awesome lobby Check in was a breeze Polite and efficient valet service Enjoyed the quiet pool with our teenage son Fitness room was adequate and updated equipment on site cafe... More"
"My family (including 2 boys, 12 9) shared a unit with my parents we were all extremely impressed with this property There really isn't a bad view from any of the balconies The property is located right on the beach the pools are all very easily accessible from any where. The kitchen was very useful the... More"
"We have a 2 bedroom resort view apartment. We opened the door and said WOW. The bedrooms are massive, two spectacular bathrooms, individually controllable air cons and ceiling fans, modern kitchen with almost everything you need to be self sufficient (there is no wooden spoon!) Comfortable king size beds, ample parking, modern fitness room, amazing pools for all tastes and... More"
"The Honua Kai Resort and Spa was the best place for our family to enjoy all that Maui has to offer. Our two bedroom unit came with a great living room, balcony with an ocean view, full kitchen to feed a family of 5, and access to pools, beach and Dukes restraurant. The room and service was great and the... More"
"Unreal facility and it is connected to the new Duke's Beach House restaurant which is fabulous! Beach is drop dead gorgeous with plenty of sea turtles. But in order to really make it happen find Dawson Chasity and they will make your vacation perfection. Best customer service anywhere. A really wonderful place to vacation!"
"Honua Kai is the best resort i have been too. We originally went for our honeymoon and returned a year later with our new son. We were on the ground floor (rented through KBR) in the Konea tower, next to the coffee shop. The resort is extremely convenient for a stroller/wheelchair access. Dukes on site doesn't offer happy hour snacks... More"
"First class building that is located directly across the highway from the West Maui Sewage treatment plant. If you room faces east this is you view. Ours was a corner unit that also had views of two abandoned construction sites. The day time winds blew the smell up the hill but at night if the winds drop the smell is... More"
"Everything was perfect and the staff was incredibly helpful. The property was clean and the pools were sparkling!! Anthony at the pool hut went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. Thanks Anthony!"
"Honua Kai was the perfect place for our honeymoon! Located along the coast, Honua Kai had both the ambiance of the ocean and the view of the mountains. It gave us a great homebase to travel around the island - both rurally and to other towns' downtown areas. The service, the food, the atmosphere - all just right and just... More"
"We stayed here in April and fell in love with the property. A year ago we stayed at the Westin Kanaapali Ocean Resort and wanted to go back there but nothing was available. We were just as happy at the Honua Kai as at the Westin! The grounds are gorgeous, there's plenty of pools, pool side service and of course,... More"
"Great place for families. The rooms are spacious and in great shape. The pools are nice and offer variety for kids or adults. The beach was right there by the pools. We would spend hours at the pool then head to the beach and back to the pool. Family of five had plenty of room with the 2 bedroom. One... More"
"Honua Kai Resort is an exemplary resort with outstanding service. OUr two bedroom suite was very comfortable with a nice kitchen and great balcony with panoramic view. It was an unforgettable stay for our family. The grounds are beautiful with waterfalls, ponds, lots of seating areas and swimming pool areas for all to enjoy. Poolside service was a nice bonus... More"
"Went with a 3.5 year old, and had a great time. The pools are well organized, where some are for adults only, some are for everyone, and some are clearly specifically for kids. Good food and drinks available poolside and at Duke's restaurant. Beautiful trails to walk or run on along the beach. Great staff."
"If you are looking for the resort feel where you are pampered day and night then this place may not be for you. If you are looking for a low key, private and relaxing honeymoon or family trip this is the place for you. My wife and I stayed in a studio on the 8th floor for 5 nights and... More"
"We arrived at around 11am. We're told room not ready yet, try in a few hours. But definitely by 4pm!! Room finally ready at 4pm as with everyone else's so we had to wait in line for check in. Because we were early our bags were last to be delivered. Waited 2 hours for our bags and ended up getting... More"
"Spent my honeymoon here, well one week of it. What a great place. Very much like a condo, they have barbq for you to use The restaurant, The Duke, is really good, but a bit pricey. Rooms are big and well worth the money."
"We have stayed here twice in the last two years for 13 and 15 days respectively. Awesome location and facilities. The choice between the pools and the beach is always a tough one (life is hard). The rooms are very good, the staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable for what you get . . . and it is... More"
"We took our family (Kids, grandkids) to Maui to celebrate my 65th b'day. We rented two condos at HK resort...one was a two bedroom, 3 bath ocean front, the other was a one bedroom and den unit. The ocean front unit was fantastic. Our grandkids could go from the unit to the pool with the waterslide and we could see... More"
"We have now stayed at Honua Kai twice and both times have been fabulous. The resort is set on a gorgeous sandy beach and has fabulous pools. You really do get the best of both worlds. The pools...amazing. There is a quiet adult pool, and three other fabulous fun pools. It's soooo kid friends with a 1/2 foot pool for... More"
"The rooms were brand new with huge balconies. A glass wall opened to the balcony so that the room was fully open to the outside. The staff was extremely friendly and courteous and the hotel was in a great location. Each unit had a full kitchen and the pool area was what you expect from a much more expensive resort.... More"
"We rented out a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom mountain facing condo at Honua Kai through a real estate agent we found on one of those websites (VRBO) where condo owners list their condos for vacation rentals. It worked out to be about 40-50 off Honua Kai's rack rate. We didn't receive cleaning services everyday just when we moved in and... More"
"We stayed at the Honua Kai in 2012 and although it has increased in price significantly it is still an amazing place. Went through VBRO and rented which was cheaper than on the hotel site. Really not a bad room the sun rises over the mountains and sets right out front. It has everything you need beautiful pools, well cleaned,... More"
"If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room."
"Love it."
"Staff were very nice and helpful, set up golf trips, got directions, provided shuttle etc. Clean rooms, nice pool,nice restaurant. hot tub is kind of small and if wanting to swim in ocean a lot, might want to stay on va beach instead of bay, but not very far away if dont mind drive."
"The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay. I would like to suggest that this particular Hotel whose location is right on the oceanfront, perhaps offer specials or services geared more towards romantic getaways."
"Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed."
"All as expected!"
"The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again."
"We were looking for a quiet retreat and we found it! Our suite had a partial waterfront view that was sublime! The decor was wonderful, and we enjoyed cooking for ourselves, although we did treat ourselves to their fabulous restaurant! We even stayed an extra day! This was our best stay in Virginia Beach, and we will be back soon!!"
"Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was great! Can't wait to come back!"
"Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet."
"Great the room was very nice n clean . We want to get away for day at beach. Wish had stay longer."
"Los cuartos muy limpios la limpieza en la alberca eso me gusto mucho todos los dias la limpian y le dedican tiempo a q quede todo bien eso se aprecia"
"We had an outstanding time here, right near the beach and minutes from the Boardwalk. We would recommend this hotel to anyone"
"I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting."
"The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep."
"Some years ago,my father in-law selected this hotel and we had a great time. After he stopped going the rest of us went down again but stayed somewhere else. Big mistake ,so this time it was without question as to where we were going. This will be our spot every year for a week. The people are great as well."
"I was very very pleased."
"We arrived at almost midnight after a long day of flying in from out of the country. The staff member who checked us in was so pleasant and helpful and even gave us 2 complimentary bottles of water. The hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and a great location to BWI. We would definitely recommend the Hilton."
"I worked a conference here video documenting the workshops. i came in late on Thursday, and didn't have the best exoerience at the bar, but they were trying to close. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was really good for 14.95. The place is older, but well maintained. The shuttle service was great. They took me to the very convenient light rail and to a restaurant. The A/V crew was also really good and respobsive."
"Everything from the staff, my room and the dining area was fabulous. The rates were great and I would recommend to anyone staying in the Baltimor area to stay at the Hilton"
"Very new. Very clean. I recommend staying there if visiting Baltimore or the surrounding area. It was a 10-15 minute drive to Baltimore from the hotel. Great price per night. The neighborhood is all hotels with a Wendy's and Bob Evans near by. I'll stay here next time I'm in the area."
"Just wonderful"
"Stay overnight to enjoy time at the Baseball Museum and Stadium. Hotel very convenient to a lot of restaurants. Hotel staff were very informational. Hotel were very precise and peaceful in spite of multiple weddings. Would definitely like to go back. Thanks."
"Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton."
"This hotel is the best experience I have had with any hotel in quite some time. The staff was first rate and they treated you as a true guest. The food was outstanding and everything was calm and respectfully. I encourage any business traveler to choose this hotel if you are staying in the Linthicum Heights area!"
"From the beginning to the end of my stay, the hotel staff was extremely accommodating. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"The staff was excellent personable and very helpful. The hotel is top quality, flat screen TV, internet connectivity, and just 3 months old at the time I visited."
"I was stranded in Baltimore for the night and needed a hotel near the airport. I reserved a room and called for a pickup. They were there within minutes and I was at the hotel in 5 minutes."
"Very clean, relatively new hotel. Flat-screen tv's in rooms and great restaurant on ground level. Highly recommended for business travelers. If you are looking to really enjoy Baltimore and relax, this may not be the hotel for you. You will end up spending a lot of for cab rides."
"I just needed to crash before an early morning flight. The airport shuttle service was fast and courteous, the hotel bar was relaxing for a nightcap, and the room had everything I needed, including a quiet night."
"The Hilton BWI was wonderful. We were greeted by staff that was friendly and helpful. The room was absolutely great. I was shocked by the 42 in Plasma TV with HD programming. The service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the price is right. I will be staying there with my wife again."
"Very nice hotel with many conveniences. We selected because they provide a shuttle to the airport and downtown. We were able to stay without having to rent a car."
"This was my second time staying at this hotel, and each time the hotel staff has been accommodating, the rooms are large, and the decor is fresh, updated. This is my go to hotel when I need a place to stay that's close to BWI airport."
"We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out."
"Excelente, lo recomiendo al 100 y esta muy cerca del aeropuerto"
"I was surprised to find a newer Hilton at such a reasonable price. I thought there would be a catch though it turned out it was just a good find. Very nice."
"I stayed a Staybridge Suites Lincoln North for a month while my new house was being completed. That is a long time to be in a hotel with two dogs who are used to having their own backyard. However, I could not have asked for a better place to stay. The staff, especially Lucas and Vita, were so friendly and... More"
"Excellent hotel, very easy to get to Little Italy. Was a weekend getaway so perfect setting."
"Great getaway!! Will stay again!!"
"This was a great hotel. Everything was brand new and clean. Friendly staff. Great location. I would highly recommend."
"seamless, clean, friendly stay in a good location just off the water in Harbor east. nice morning breakfast. Nice premium hotel in a convenient area."
"I recommend it for a quick, couples getaway, walk the area, lots of restaurants, taverns, and live music."
"Drs appt at jhh. Shuttle convenient. Breakfast good."
"Excellent service, great size rooms and great location for my family to stay while I had surgery."
"Very nice and modern hotel. Nice complimentary breakfast. Nice size rooms with separate couch area. Very friendly staff. Easy to walk to restaurants and Inner Harbour and Fells Landing. Convenient parking."
"Upon arrival, we were welcomed courteously. The receptionist gave us a corner room with a convertible sofa bed. The extra space gave us plenty of room to place all the things needed for the wedding. The daily breakfast which were delicious was very convenient to start our daily activities. The housekeeping staff were very accommodating and courteous and helpful. The security staff were always present near the front door and very welcoming"
"We loved the Hyatt Place Baltimore! Harbor East is a fantastic neighborhood, full of shopping and great restaurants. It is convenient walk to the bay and to Fell's Point. The rooms are very nice and the staff were very courteous. Thank you for a great long weekend!"
"Great experience. Friendly, helpful staff."
"Great area, very clean and friendly. Traveling for business, would've been nice to have earlier breakfast options."
"Very nice breakfast with lots of choices, high quality offerings and comfortable seating"
"When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana. At about midnight, we had to pack up all our stuff with a 3 and 5 year old and swap rooms. Hotel offered no type of reimbursement or anything."
"very nice hotel, but a little high price"
"Just a wonderful time the staff was outstanding."
"Brand new feeling, chic, expert decor design. Beautiful rooms with sitting area, glass shower. Small fitness room with dumbbells, small indoor pool. One block from Whole Foods, 2 blocks from Four Seasons, located in East Harbor. Good price. I would do again."
"3-block walk to the inner harbor. Staff was excellent - front desk manager carried bags to my room for me since there were no luggage carts available... Will stay again if I visit Baltimore again!"
"Close enough to the harbor or be an easy walk. Near a movie theatre and an ice cream store. Very convenient."
"My girlfriends and I celebrated there BIRTHDAY and Recovery in Bmore. It was our first time in the hotel. The staff was excellent especially the Manager(Rozellen) She very helpful in given us the best restaurant and clubs to go to..Only bad thing I didn't like was paying too much for valet parking it was very costly... But overall it was close to the harbor the other end by Fells Street which was great small local shops and bars. If you looking for different view of Baltimore this hotel is where u need to be.. We shall be back in June"
"Everything was amazing! The staff was very helpful and professional at all times! It was a very welcoming atmosphere. It is located in a great area where everything(mall, restaurants, aquarium,museum etc) is in walking distance."
"second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool)."
"Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time."
"I was here for a business trip. I could not believe the cleanliness and size of the room. Good staff and breakfast as well"
"The hotel is well located. The room was great. Staff very helpful and polite. Breakfast was not the best."
"New hotel...nice size rooms and large bathroom. Great breakfast selections. Inner Harbor 4 block walk...good dining within close walking distance in Italian Town or Fels point."
"Last second decision to visit Baltimore. We were greeted by Marq, a pleasant young man, who upgraded us to a king suite. She even provided us discounted tickets to the aquarium when we checked out the following day. The room was very spacious, clean and quiet. (Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about. Overall, the staff was very courteous and the hotel had a modern edge look which suited us just fine. Marq was the superstar during our stay. HIgh recommendation."
"My second stay was almost as pleasant as my first. The room and amenities werE comfortable and well appointed."
"The staff were so helpful, the breakfast was delicious, and the beds were very comfortable!"
"Hotel is in a great location, easy walk to inner harbor. Plenty of restaurants to chose from as well. Staff was super friendly, let us check in early and kept our bags after checkout."
"The Snow lol in I have to leave there How comfortable the bed in room was really nice I needed the peace in time to myself."
"Good: Staff, especially breakfast staff did an amazing job."
"Good: Best breakfast I ever had!!!"
"Bad: The eggs was nasty."
"Good: Location to the Inner Harbor and things to do is perfect. The daily breakfast was outstanding."
"Bad: Nothing to really complain about. Good: Only 2 blocks from from Inner Harbor. Everything was in walking distance. Breakfast was great. Very clean. Front Desk people where very pleasant."
"Bathroom had no soap,tissues. Took over 1/2 hr to get car Very friendly staff"
"Bad: Nothing 1. Good: Very, Very, relaxing!!! All the ammenities were in walking distance of the the hotel."
"Bad: If it was not for the staff, my request through booking.com would not have been filled correctly (room type). Good: Everything was very clean and the staff was very professional."
"Nadia is the best!!!!"
"Bad: UnSweetened iced tea would be good. Good: I like the waffles"
"Good: Breakfast was good!"
"the only negative comment i have is that thr room service breakfast waas not very good at all. other than that our stay was excellent and i would recommend it to everyone staying in the area."
"Good: Monte made my eggs to perfection, just the way I asked."
"Bad: Supposed to get call when room was ready. Did get a text but only to text if I needed assistance. Not really much of a problem as timing between eating and room being ready before evening event worked out. Good: Within walking distance to evrything we did. Parking adjacent to motel. Have stayed"
"The hotel was clean. The staff was excellent. I truly enjoyed my stay."
"The Pier 5 Hotel is at a great Baltimore location at the Inner Harbor. It is one of the smaller hotels but size isn't important. The convenience to the harbor and restaurants is terrific."
"Loved it. Had a wonderful stay."
"Walking distance to everything in the Inner Harbor Area. Enjoyed walking everywhere and exploring. The hotel is close to the aquarium, restaurants, shopping, etc. The staff was very friendly, enjoyed crabby hour, and the room was comfortable."
"Fun decor in lobby and in rooms. Nice ammenities. Bed was extremely comforable, one of the best nights sleep ever!"
"it was very clean. the people were very friendly. it was right on the harbor so everything was walking distance."
"Don't misunderstand - we would fully recommend the hotel itself. The restaurant Pizzazz Tuscan Grille is another story. Food was OK, portions were small for the and service was bad. There are much better choices nearby."
"Bad: There is nothing I didn't like. Good: Very friendly staff and very clean."
"We were very pleased with the room and thought the location of the hotel was great. It was a no hassle experience to bring our dog which was wonderful. The only negative was that they couldn't find our reservation right away, but that may have been because we have a two part last name."
"Revamped retro boutique hotel with exemplary service and the coolest decorating...top notch"
"Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross. We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location."
"Accessible to any places you want to go. Not that much of amenities in the hotel but still safe and cozy to stay in. Everyday they have Craby Hour - Free food/drinks."
"The Pier 5 Hotel is excellent for a quite romantic weekend. Once you check in, you have Ruth Chris or McCormick and Schmick's right off the hotel lobby. Within walking distance is the entire Baltimore waterfront district with nightclubs for just about everyone. The only downside was parking. While parking is available next to the hotel, the cost is 22.00 per pay and if you use valet parking, it 29.00 per day. You would think for the price they charge per night for a room, parking would be included."
"We loved this Hotel, great location, clean and staff very friendly and helpful. They even let my dog come for no extra charge! we would go back in a heartbeat, infact next year we are.."
"The hotel location was excellent. The attached restaurants are high end and perfect for celebrating a special occasion. The Saturday afternoon chocolate and champagne tasting was a real treat. The included breakfast had made to order omelettes with all fresh ingredients. Bathroom was spacious and the room was cozy. I would return here on my next trip to Baltimore."
"Unfortunately, we had an emergency as soon as we walked off the plane. I received a phone call that my brother had passed away. When I got to the hotel and explained it to the front desk supervisor, Empriss, she was very compassionate. She did everything in her power to make our shortened stay as comfortable as possible. All the staff were very friendly and I plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Our room was awesome. Very clean. The view was awesome. We plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Thanks Empriss for being so kind and caring."
"Good: the dcor, the cleanliness, the comfortable bed and the location!"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: For a 6 day stay, the space was wonderful"
"Good: Staff were all extremely friendly. Hotel was clean."
"Bad: Parking is probably the only downside. You have to park in a parking garage which is fine, but expensive. But I guess thats what you get for staying in the city. It was all worth it though because the location was amazing. Good: The location is amazing. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and comfortable for my family of 4. The free breakfast was also great. We had an issue with internet that was taken care of really quickly. We had a great time and look forward to staying again"
"Bad: Need something horizontal in bathroom. . Good: Great accommodations, central location, great food."
"nothing the location and the front desk girls were excellent."
"Bad: Breakfast. Good: Excellent family enjoyed everything. Staff friendly and helpful. Arrived early gave phone number and they called when room was ready 2 hours before check in. Location wonderful for us, we walked every where. Direct access to beach. Outside pool great, food there was good too and not to pricey. Overall great stay. Well worth the price. U get what u pay for. Breakfast could have been a lil better, my personal opinion."
"Hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly as well as informative."
"Bad: Great staff very accommodating. Clean friendly."
"Good: Breakfast was wonderful, all service staff was so great, housekeeping and front desk perfect.. cant wait to go again and stay here."
"Friendly staff, yummy food."
"Good: Front desk staff facilities"
"Good: Position, building, room design and comfort, rooftop pool"
"Good: Awesome location one block from the beach, and a small swimming pool on the roof. Nice balcony also!"
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Everything"
"Excellent hotel with a very up-market feel in a great location. Right on Ocean Drive but quite."
"Bad: That we were only there for 2 nights. Good: Very spacious room, with a partial ocean view from the balcony. Rooftop pool and seating looked amazing. Staff were very friendly, and food was excellent. Eric's 'Honey Jalapeno Ginger Margaritas' were superb!"
"Good: Everything with this place is sensational!! alhensadro the waiter has the best guest service we have ever experienced, rooms are clean tidy and beds are very comfortable"
"Staff was excellent. Room was great and the atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful. As far as location - how can you go wrong a block off the beach"
"Bad: Though I booked through Bookings.com, they had no record of my reservations nor could they find any. They compted us and our driver with free drinks until they got it straightened out. Fortunately they still had a double room. The manager bought dessert after our lovely bar light dinner as well!!. Good: We had a wonderful stay prior to an early morning flight to Geneva, Switzerland"
"Bad: Lots of chlorine in the pool area. Good: I really enjoyed my stay there"
"Bad: bathtub too slippery. Good: the breakfast and fruit water"
"Good: I loved having a microwave and fridge. Very cozy!"
"Bad: Couldn't have been any better. Good: It was absolutely great! Little hidden gem in the middle of South Beach!"
"Good: Spacious, super friendly staff, cleanliness, location, atmosphere"
"Bad: Coffee could be better quality. Good: The position if the room at the ba k away from the street was excellent. There was no bar so no young noisy people!! Yeah!! The veranda and the garden area was well shaded so could sit out in the cool. Near shops and two minutes to beach."
"Bad: Nothing. Good: Beautiful and romantic"
"We stayed at the La Quinta while we attended the dog show in Perry, GA. Its about a 20-25 minute drive away. The hotel is clean with a very friendly staff. The desk clerk Sam was especially polite and his tip for a restaurant El Cotija was spot on especially with 5 pitchers on Thursdays. We stayed on the 2nd... More"
"Excellent stay! Clean, spacious, handicapped accessible king suite. Friendly, helpful staff. Breakfast feast! A home away from home! My only regret is we only stayed one night. I had such an enjoyable stay, I will be making reservations today for the 2016 games!!!"
"I probably shouldn't brag too much, l don't want the secret to get out what a awesome place this is to stay. Billy, the manager is so nice to deal with, we stay at least every two months and all I do is called the hotel direct and he makes my reservation. Sam is another clerk who's always ready to... More"
"The hotel is very clean, comfortable, in a great location and the staff was both nice and helpful to guests! The breakfast we plentiful, and thats not always the case! Best price hotel within a reasonable distance from the falls and other attractions."
"We had to be up in the area Buffalo/Niagara Falls for a new business venture and we didn't want to spend a fortune so we chose this property. From the front desk to the breakfast and most comfortable bed, our stay there was exceptional. I would totally recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay!!"
"Very nice quiet rooms (all separated) with their own courtyard. Very friendly staff. Short walk to town and wine tasting!"
"The room was nice and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. There were always refreshments in the lobby. The lemonade was good as were the cookies. The staff offered us bottled water after check in and they were all friendly.It makes our day to hear that we excelled your expectations of cleanliness during your stay! Thank you so much for your five star review, and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit."
"I thought it could b a lot cleaner! Love the hotel but grounds and our patio could been a lot cleaner!"
"We were within walking distance to the town, shops, and restaurants. The bed had the same beautiful linens as Congress Hall. The trolley ride through the decorated town was fun."
"We experienced a comfortable, welcoming, restful stay and enjoyed breakfast in the morning. I appreciated the cleanliness of our room, the interactions the whole family had with the staff and the choices and presentation of the food at breakfast."
"I loved everything about this hotel. It was clean and the staff was pretty darn awesome. Great dining experience and the hotel shuttle was fast and convenient. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone on business or leisure!!"
"I always stay at the Hyatt. It is the best. A very nice experience and good food also. The folks at the desk and restaurant are always very helpful and friendly. Hotel is kept up with quality and cleanliness throughout."
"I stayed at the Hyatt Place while visiting Atlanta for a conference at a nearby hotel. I needed a ride to the other hotel and the Hyatt shuttle driver graciously took me there even though it was not on his route. That courtesy made me feel safe. My room was nice and clean. The staff friendly and kind. Always asking... More"
"We had a quick one night stay in Atlanta for business meetings. This hotel was great in terms of being quiet, short shuttle drive from Airport. The staff was very friendly at the front desk. They were very welcoming and quickly took care of multiple tasks and requests from guests. The room was enjoyable and as expected for a Hyatt... More"
"One night stay before flight home. All we needed and with a 12 noon check out - good room, clean comfortable. Also used the food service for meal upon arrival - good value, tasty made to order plus the inclusive breakfast. Only slight niggle was checking in when the receptionist (only member we could see apparently on duty)... More"
"Nice place convenient to airport before or after a flight. Airport shuttle between airport and hotel. Parking available short and long term. Comfortable room with sofa and work desk. Good burger place just across the parking lot."
"This is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. It's very close to the Atlanta airport, which is convenient, although we did hear the planes off and on. It has a small Starbucks inside the lobby, and fresh salads and wraps for purchase anytime also."
"The staff were outstanding! So professional courteous! I will definitely stay here again!"
"Stayed last week at the Hyatt Place Atlanta Airport South. I love this hotel and the team is just the best there is! This is the perfect destination for me after any journey particularly after long international flights. The team at reception is friendly and welcoming, the room is clean and properly prepared. Wi fi worked great. The 24 hour... More"
"I only stayed here one night. The breakfast was above average. The rooms were clean and quiet. LARGE TV for a hotel room. Comfortable pillows. I felt the rate was reasonable. It was a short walk to the nearby restaurant. That wasn't a problem in nice weather, but it might be a problem in bad weather if you didn't have... More"
"Room cleanliness Excellent customer service Location convenient from Airport"
"Staying at this hotel just made sense for us. My husband had to travel to CA and I had to stay in GA but about 45 mins away from the airport and we were very tired. It was so convenient for us to check into this hotel late evening, enjoy the ambiance and comfort of the hotel, get some rest,... More"
"Hotel was easy to and from Hartsfield Jackson airport. Shopping and restaurants you had to travel on the interstate. The room was big and comfortable. Bed was comfortable as well. Bathroom a little small but clean."
"Hyatt Places are consistently guest friendly, offer the amenities that appeal to both the pleasure and business traveler, and are our preferred hotel when traveling. We always find the breakfast handy and offering a variety of food options, and most of the hotels offer a small bar with adult beverages, perfect for a nightcap."
"The hotel was very comfortable. I was there for one night, and chose it for the location. The staff was very nice and welcoming, the bed was super-comfortable, and I melted right into it. I awoke fresh, had a great breakfast in the lobby, and took the shuttle to the airport. Of course, the shuttle left precisely on time, as... More"
"Nice hotel and perfect location with easy access to ATL domestic and international terminal. Great staff and facilities. Rooms are spacious and good wifi. Amenities are great for a very reasonable price."
"Loved our overnight at The Table Mountain Inn. Friendly service coupled with a very clean, well appointed room. So nice to see a boutique hotel rather than a chain in a downtown like Golden"
"This is an authentic style motel with a fantastic restaurant. close to all the attractions. we had a room with balcony overlooking town, ( a must) . Good shopping close by and some great eating choices"
"my family and i visited my nephew who is in school in winchester, va. the receptionist at the desk called me to make sure that i requested a smoking room. (i had) she was concerned that i get the room i wanted because of the apple festival. after having had many negative experiences with smoking rooms, i was afraid that... More"
"Wonderful suite hotel in Flagstaff. Convenient, although not in town. This I see as a positive. Everything was clean and efficiently run. Room was simple but very adequate for our needs which were just two nights and would be fine for long-term stays, as well. Really, we were delighted with this hotel."
"From the moment we arrived to the second we left the hotel was amazing. Excellent affordability without skimping on quality. The staff team we so helpful and friendly. The hotel is situated in a central location with good access to Route 66 and The Grand Canyon We loved it"
"Brilliant place. Just wish we had spent more time as we only stayed one night, as we used as a base to see the Grand Canyon. We all really enjoyed the complementary full breakfast. Lovely double rooms with plenty of space"
"Traveled across country..made many stops with our 2 dogs This was the most pleasant.most clean and most dog friendly of all.Would definitely stay again and recommend to a friend.Super cozy just like home."

"We loved everything about the trip. Oak Creek Canyon was beautiful and Slide Rock was amazing! The hotel was great. We loved going out on the patio at night to drink tea and look at the shadows on the beautiful red rocks."
"Well ran and very nicely maintained. Staff is friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. I enjoyed conversations with both the evening and day shift. Breakfast was well prepared and varied to suit different tastes. Location is good for walking to shops and driving up Oak Creek Canyon. Lots of little places to relax on the grounds. Beds were comfortable and the accessible... More"
"We paid 339.00 plus 50.00 tax for a room that faced a busy to lane road..plus the entrance to the hotel...and dumpster across the street. Not a the stunning view of Sedona. I was told that those rooms were another 30.00 more. I travel a lot and in all honesty this hotel...is trying to be something it is not. I... More"
"The hotel is in a great location, right on main street and walkable to a lot of shops, restaurants, etc. The hotel was nice, clean, comfortable. The staff was helpful, friendly and professional. To wake up and look at the red rocks (Snoopy Lucy) and others from our room was an extra treat."

This trip was the first my husband and I had taken without our children in 8 years so I wanted it to be nice. But I just couldn't stomach paying the amount of money that other hotel was asking... More"
"The Best Western is a great hotel and right in the heart of Sedona! It's a quick walk to shops and restaurants. It's also a quick drive to various state parks, Cathedral Rock, Chapel of the Christ Church, etc. The hotel staff were great and the pool and other amenities (fitness center, game room, etc.)were fantastic. I highly recommend this... More"
"Amazing red rock views -- especially at sunset! Right in the heart of downtown Sedona -- everything is within walking distance! They also have condos that will accommodate families. Walk down to the creek at the back of the property! The views and sounds are very calming! Can't say enough good things about Sedona in general!!!"
"We travel to Sedona for one week every year and have tried a number of luxury hotels (including L'Auberge). This is now our favorite!! We had a 2 bedroom creekside condo. The bottom floor had a large living room with a pull-out couch (and room darkening shades) and a large TV, full kitchen and half bath. There was also a... More"
"Great staff and very friendly. Room was very clean, comfortable beds, and very good continental breakfasts delivered to our rooms. We will recommend and would definitely return on a future trip. Amenities in the room were very nice."
"I travel a bunch and lean toward staying at Marriott locations. I was delighted to have spent several weeks at the Residence Inn in Richardson Texas. Location, consistency, cleanliness and good people on staff. Lisa, Johanna, Josh, Laila, Linda, Sylvia, Sheila and Vanessa all were welcoming and helpful. Thank you all!"
"This was one of my best trips ever for me and my family. The big comfy beds with those comfy stuffed pillows!!! My sleep was impeccable during my stay, I didn't wake up tired, I woke up energized to a complimentary breakfast downstairs!!Thank you so much for your review. We are thrilled to know how much you enjoyed your visit and we look forward to seeing you again soon! Warm Regards, Keith Beears General Manager"
"Stayed here for a week before boarding the Carnival Glory - it was amazing - room was SO comfortable!! Really really enjoyed ourselves - towel animals each evening and chocolates on the pillow were a lovely touch! Visited in October, hotel wasn't very busy which we liked. The restaurant in the hotel was very nice and whenever I couldn't finish... More"
"The hotel was beautiful inside now can't wait to go back again this summer. The atrium balcony is a must."
"Great stay. I have no complaints. Me and my family were very pleased and would have love to stay longer. I would definitely recommend this hotel to any and everyone."
"We had a great time. Everyone we met was super nice. Lots of amenities. We enjoyed our stay."
"Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else."
"Hotel and Service was Fantastic!"
"Is was amazing love everything on the hotel. We have the best 15 anniversary. We definitely go again."
"Great hotel with convenient access to many things in Orlando. Sea World is literally across the street so you can walk to it. Orlando (Orange County) Convention Center is less than 10 min drive. 15 min drive from Airport. Outstanding fitness center with many workout machines (chest, back, biceps, triceps, legs, etc.), dumbbells, cardio, spinning bikes, and more. As a... More"
"The front desk associate Brad was great, I really enjoyed my check-in and check-out through him. The buffet breakfast was also a great deal that I included in my package and if your traveling with kids the kiddie pool was pretty cool too."
"The Good: This Hampton Inn really stood out from the other Hampton Inns I've stayed at in recent weeks. The bed and room was really clean, well maintained, and very comfortable. The staff was really friendly and helpful. And the breakfast was better than usual every morning. Not sure what is different in the ingredients at some Hampton Inns. Even... More"
"My son got accepted to Stanford University so we went to the admit weekend!. This location is a bit far from the school, besides paying 5usd for toll, and the rush hour traffic, it was pretty good, and the sites on the way made it worth it!"
"This was our 2nd time staying at this Hampton Inn. Both times we have had a great experience! We always stay in King suite. The price is reasonable per night, esp. if you are a Hilton HHonors member a AAA member, but if not, you'll still get a great price. You will not be dis-satisfied."
"The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full."
"Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean. We appreciated the manager's reception and our daughter loved the pool. As for room service- the quality was there and the gentleman who brought our food was kind and courteous. We plan to stay again soon."
"The hotel is a bit pricey for MY pocketbook but I think it's because of the time we went (Capital Jazz Fest). However, for all they offer it was worth it."
"We were meeting family in Baltimore/near the stadium. It was so nice for the hotel to shuttle us to the light rail which then took us to Camden Yards. Was nice not to worry about parking and driving. thank you!"
"The suite was very spacious and the amenities were good. The living room has comfortable chairs, a roomy couch/convertible bed, and an adequate dining area. The bedroom made sleeping easy and pleasurable. Although the hotel's fitness room is sparse the pool and spa are delightful with its glass ceiling and walls providing great views of the surrounding foliage. I also enjoyed the complementary full breakfast with eggs made to order. I will definitely return to this hotel."
"Very clean hotel the beds very nice and close to the airport."
"Your staff is extremely friendly, sincere and professional. A sense of caring, and security was clearly evident - with a driver to ensure a positive experience was provided. Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item. Loved all of it and will certainly be back. Being from Hawaii, this stay was very nice and very warm !! Travel to Maryland often and first time staying here, but not the last."
"Best stay at a hotel."
"very nice stay.. will be back to another location"
"Only stayed one night but that was enough to enjoy my stay. The hotel and room were very clean and looked to be recently redone within the last few years. The staff was very courteous and professional. We ate at the hotel restaurant and found the food to be excellent. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is staying in the area."
"I have been staying at the Four Points Sheraton in Plainview dozens of times in the past 5 years. The hotel staff is very friendly. There is a bar with a great beer selection and dinner menu. Michael at the bar is a rare individual with a constant smile and great sense of humor. The guys in the kitchen take... More"

The pool was super clean along with the rooms and we have so much fun so far:) we will definitely be returning :) thanks again Erik!"
"Had a room on the harbor side and was treated to a manatee siting our first evening there. Comfortable, clean room with washer/dryer--great for tennis players. Excellent time at the tennis center--games set up for us by Zoe every day we were there. Rode bikes one afternoon, one afternoon at the spa--perfect!"
"Joseph's service made our trip! He accommodated all of our requests and even went above and beyond to make our trip as nice as possible! He not only arranged our chairs and umbrellas by the beach but he also positioned the cushions and towels so that we were as comfortable as possible. He was amazing!"
"Place is outstanding!! The people here treat you like gold!! I was very happy with our entire experience here! Karl did an awesome job setting everything up for us every time we came to the beach! No matter what we needed, he was there. Very helpful and outstanding customer service. He also gave us a lot of input on places... More"

"I've spent alot of time at LBKC and the staff is fantastic. But this week Zack is the man! We had come to the beach late with hopes of getting chairs up front by the gulf (we knew it would be tough mid day on a weekend) and as expected it was busy. But within minutes Zack worked his magic... More"
"Hunter was very attentive and welcoming on our first day! He helped us set up our chairs and made sure we were comfortable. Very polite staff and gorgeous resort, Looking forward to the rest of our stay."
"First time we had stayed at this resort, we chose this report for its location and it was one of the more expensive hotels so presumed it would be good !!!! Room was in very poor condition and very worn out as a lot of the communal areas were, air condition couldn't be left on as the noise was horrendous... More"
"Amazing!! From the impeccable service at the front desk, at the pool, on the beach to the luxurious accommodations with breathtaking view, to the incredible fun had by all, including the kids - we couldn't be happier with the memorable weekend.

"Freddy, Jake, Ozzy, and Ally were very good at keeping my friends and I satisfied while we enjoyed the gorgeous view here at the beach. They were ready to work and very enthusiastic during service! I definitely will be coming back and it was an amazing day at the beach!"
"We decided to go to Charleston for Thanksgiving weekend and had an enjoyable experience. Great location within an easy walk to all of the attractions. The rooms are super clean and comfortable and the courtyard is well maintained. The free breakfast in the morning followed by the wine and cheese pairings every evening make this a must stay when in... More"
"I read the Trip Advisor reviews prior to making reservations for a 3-day stay and felt comfortable with the anticipated accommodations. Now I am doubting if we stayed at the same place! Cannot comprehend all the high praise given this hotel/inn. The check in area is small and poorly lit. I feel sorry for the staff working in such an... More"
"I have stayed at Indigo Inn several times and am always pleased with the room and especially the breakfast and afternoon food selections. Breakfast is GREAT .... in the afternoon they offer cheeses and crackers, etc. My only complaint is that the outdoor area has several fountains and I am not sure if these are the source of the smell... More"

The courtyard is lovely place for breakfast and Indigo is within walking distance to historic Charleston. The staff was friendly and very attentive. Would definitely return."
"The people were friendly and accomodating. The free breakfast foods delicious, and the complimentary evening cocktail party well supplied. The room was comfortable, and the location is great for touring Charleston, as it's so easy to get in and out for touring and shopping. A great place!"
"I am sad to say this place is very unhospitable. At least when I stayed. They advertise a shuttle service Frisco shuttle who are very unreliable. We paid them to pick us up and they were a no show when we finally got someone on the phone the hung up on us. When we called the hotel for help... More"
"We stayed here with 5 of us, including 3 teenagers. It was a GEM. A real, two-bedroom apartment, with a full kitchen and a living room. I was expecting an ordinary hotel suite, and got much much more. We only stayed one night, so we didn't get a chance to use the pool or the restaurant/bar, but both looked very... More"
"I was here with my teenaged son. We enjoyed our stay at this quiet, well-maintained hotel in a residential part of Santa Barbara just a short walk from the mission, and a short walk from downtown. His post-op visit this time only required a one-night stay. However, last summer after he required a medical procedure, we spent over two weeks... More"
"We travel to Santa Barbara several times a year to see family. This place was fabulous. Reasonable for Santa Barbara, great service, lovely place close to State St. and everything, and the little restaurant was FABULOUS. Darned if I didn't have the best eggs benedict ever. Not kidding. Ever. With arugala. And the nicest part was it was included with... More"
"With my daughter at UCSB it seems I have tried everything from VRBO to El Capitan tents in the Santa Barbara area! This hotel was a pleasant surprise even though it is tucked away in a residential area a few miles from the beach. I love when hotels provide the little extras when you get to your room. My room...

"I love this Best Western Plus hotel, because I know I will have a pleasant stay. To begin with, the hotel bed and pillows were inviting, allowing me to have a good nights sleep. After my peaceful sleep I enjoyed a nice breakfast from the on-site restaurant. Checking out was a breeze, allowing me to get to destination quickly. I... More"

"Everything was awesome. It was our second time staying at base camp, everyone there was just as friendly and helpful as the first time we stayed there last year. We are looking forward to returning during the summer season to enjoy the short walk to the lake."
"I love the whole property and vibe, all the different levels of the hotel with the firepits are awesome. The courtyard with cornhole is always fun. And the assortment of beers is the best part of course. The staff is very friendly and Will especially helped me with samples to find the best beer."
"We stayed here while traveling. There are lots of hotels very close by but we are really, really happy with our choice of the Comfort Suites. The hotel has been completely renovated. The hotel is beautiful with a 4 story lobby and the room was really nice. The staff accommodated all of our requests to be in a quiet area.... More"
"I really like this hotel. The staff is friendly helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable. It is quiet and allows for a great nights sleep. For the price you can't beat it. As a female on business alone I felt safe in this hotel. The lobby is bright and always staffed."
"Hotel was great Portland was not nothing is open on Mondays"
"Great urban hotel by the riverfront in Portland, with excellent city walking into downtown area of Portland -- lots of great surrounding restaurants in the nearby areas. Happy hour wine and appetizers at Hotel Rose are a bargain. Try the bacon wrapped date with chorizo stuffing. Staff was friendly and super helpful."
"We arrived in Austin and the HOMEWOOD SUITES/ AUSTIN, ARBORETUM N.W. where we were greeted by the friendly staff. Robin was working the front desk. Every staff member we encountered during our stay, asked if we needed anything, and all seemed to really care that we felt comfortable in our suite, had everything we needed, etc. Carlos was so helpful... More"
"The propose of this hotel is that you would fell like home. The main differentiation from the Hampton inn for instance is that has a small door and a separate living, so if you cook or simply pop a popcorn, the smell won't take over the whole bedroom. I would recommend this hotel specially if you need to be in... More"
"Our house in currently under construction and my family and I selected the Homewood Suites in North Austin as a safe haven during the madness. My entire family has settled in to the room and amenities - the meals and the service are fantastic. Claire operates the kitchen in the evenings and hosts several breakfast buffets in the mornings as... More"

He was extremely friendly and helpful as were all the staff we had dealings with. Our two... More"
"We have stayed at this hotel twice in the last year and we love it.

We come to Austin to visit our son and are very pleased with the amenities that this hotel has to offer... More"
"Very pleasant experience, I have no complaints whatsoever. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and quiet. Reasonably priced as well. The breakfast wasn't the World's best but it did the job! I would recommend if you are needing to stay in the Austin area."
"Quiet and comfortable stay. Close to major roads but far enough away that you are not disturbed by the traffic.. The staff here was fantastic. Jason at the front desk greeted us by name every time we entered the hotel. Good breakfast served every morning and dinner was served Monday through Thursday. Will stay here in a heartbeat on our...

"The Hampton at Gateway Park was an excellent choice on my recent trip to Denver. It appears the hotel is newer, the facilities were spotless, room was clean, quiet and very roomy with a kitchette. The work area was very large so I was able to get my work done. I always find Hampton's to be consistently nice in a... More"
"Nice place all around with great amenities, good breakfast, nice staff. For some reason though, at night the hotel smelled like sewage. Really. Also, my credit card pending charge is 90 more than my checkout receipt."
"We were in Colorado for soccer tournaments and this hotel was in close proximity to the Aurora Sports Complex. This staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. There are several restaurants within walking distance and it also offers a shuttle to the airport. I would recommend this hotel and will stay there again the next time we are in... More"
"Our flight was cancelled due to the Southwest computer debacle of July 2016 so we needed to find rooms with very little notice. Fortunately the Hampton Inn Suites Denver/Airport-Gateway Park had space for us. After I returned our rental car Hampton sent a very luxurious shuttle bus to pick me up at the airport. The hotel was within convenient... More"
"Amazing staff and awesome accommodations!!! I'd visit Colorado just to spend the night here! I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wishes to enjoy a good nights sleep, top notch Staff. Extremely nice and friendly!"
"With the price, and with 4 kids tagging along, it was a pleasant stay! The front desk guy was Jermaine (if I recall correctly), and he was nice and very helpful. The lady at the breakfast station was also nice. In fact all the hotel staff that I met was nice and helpful."
"Great little getaway for our anniversary. Bed was comfortable, staff very nice and friendly, room very clean. Would stay again soon."

"Very happy all around, would highly recommend"

"The atmosphere of the hotel was excellent! Every staff worker that I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful!

You will definitely be satisfied!"
"Great room! Plenty of space for 4 people"
"Came to stay on way home from Baltimore- testing for husband- and had to meet in moyock NC. So decided rather then drive to OBX and turn around and drive back we stayed in Newport News. The staff was very nice- the room quiet and comfortable- and the area good for eats and shopping."

"I've stayed here several times and the service here is always above and beyond the call of duty.Clean rooms,great breakfast bar and we love Helen to death! Highly recommend this rest stop! 5 stars! You will be glad you stayed here!"
"The hotel and staff were nice but upon check in I was given a double when I requested a KING. About 3 hours into my stay another family was trying to enter my room. It seems that I had been given the wrong room by the front desk attendant. They corrected the matter only after the family went to the... More"
"the staff very helpful and accommodating throughout the entire stay, breakfast was excellent and rooms were clean. pool was nice and clean and environment as a whole was very comfortable in feeling. location was close to much activities to participate in"
"A perfect location for a weekend excursion from NYC. This hotel is approximately 20 mins from two NY wineries one being the Brotherhood Winery which is the oldest in the USA. This Hampton Inn has a delightful all-American all-you-eat breakfast buffet. This Inn is a great value for your money and the location. Also pet-friendly."
"This is NOT your typical hotel that allows pets. It is exactly what you'd expect from the Hilton/Hampton brand. Clean, lovely dcor and bedding. I highly recommend this motel and wish there were more like it so we could travel with our pet without lowering our expectations."
"We booked this room through Hotwire for 1 night. We paid 162. Within 5 minutes of sitting on one of the beds, our son felt a bed bug crawling on his leg. We immediately pulled back the covers and the mattress pad and discovered 2 more bed bugs. Who knows how many others were lurking elsewhere! So, we called the... More"
"The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and well maintained. I did find a couple of ladybugs near the window, but nothing to worry about. The TV even had a sleep timer. Love that feature."
"Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Staff was very friendly and the bed was pretty comfortable. They had a good breakfast and the waffles were delicious! The only somewhat negative thing is the size of the bathroom. It was a tight squeeze for two people to get ready in the morning but how much time do you really spend in... More"
"I like the face-lift on the property. It felt like a new hotel. The breakfast was great ! Overall, it was comfortable."
"We travel fairly often and stayed in a lot of hotels. This is the most strange experience we have ever had (in a bad way). We pre-paid three nights' stay. After the first night, we went out to tour the city. When we came back in the evening, we realized all the stuff we left in the closet, the dresser... More"
"We stay at this hotel any time we go to Nashville. Friendly Staff.. very nice rooms... good price. We love being close to so many nice restaurants and the Opry Mills Mall! We stay here with our children and their families every Thanksgiving weekend. Perfect for us!!!!"
"This was a nice clean, quiet facility with a larger room that I expected. We will come back and stay here again. The location was very handy for Opry Mills shopping without the expense of some other facilities."
"The staff is amazing and always helpful. So far I have definitely enjoyed my stay. Traveling with my company we have to share a vehicle, but the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and the West Valley Mall. For me this hotel gets 2 thumbs up from me for location combined with a superior staff,... More"

The staff was pleasant and provided a shuttle to and from the airport if needed. Ample parking space. Breakfast was included and had plenty to choose from and lots of seating."
"We liked the garden feeling of the one story rooms in the back near the pool. Very lovely and quiet. Nice big trees around. Also, there was a lot of counter space in the bathroom which was handy. We thought of staying somewhere that cost less, read reviews and decided to go ahead and stay here instead. Good idea. You... More"

"Our son and daughter in law had a great wedding. Venue was excellent. The food was very good. One of the best weddings I've ever attended. The staff was professional and courteous. The wedding planners anticipated every need and made it a pleasant experience."
"This is our second stay at Hotel Maya. I have nothing but great things to say about our experience there. First, the location is perfect. The hotel is only a few minutes from downtown Long Beach, L.A., the airports and all the beautiful beaches along Pacific Coast Highway. The views from the guest room are beautiful! Second, the service is... More"
"I have been a regular visitor to this hotel for a long time. The staff are fantastic, the views stunning and without doubt it really is a 'Best Kept Secret'. It only gets better!!! You will not be disappointed. I recommend a visit."

"We spent my husband 50th Birthday at the Hotel Maya and it was a dream come true. This was not our first stay and won't be our last. Mr. Fernando Chavez and front office staff just blew us away with.."
"Far out of the hustle and bustle of California traffic. Beautiful scenery of the marina and Queen Mary. Clean, comfortable. Enjoyed nights by their fire pit and the wonderful Fuego restaurant. We would definitely stay there again.We agree it is a perfect Romantic getaway and we do get lots of proposals made here. We are glad you enjoyed it and relaxed around our fire pits. Come back again soon."
"Loved the rooms and the views and the peacefulness of the hotel! Staff was exellent! Breakfast was great and the view from the Fuego restaurant was amazing! Also loved the spanish music playing in the lobby area (REIK) Thanks for the amazing review. We are glad you loved it. Come back soon!"
"We loved this hotel - particularly as we had left a pretty grim hotel to turn up here without a booking, as a last resort. The staff was amazing, the food in the restaurant exceptional and the Fourth of July vibe, fun and friendly but not crazy."
"Great place to just separate yourself from the hustle of Los Angeles. They over exceeded all expectations. When you're at the restaurant order the Cubano Sandwich, and do consider the options for dessert. We missed out on the dessert part because of the cookies at the Front Desk. Thank you so much for the upgrade to the balcony view. It... More"

"Great overall experience Staff was very friendly. Got a hot cookie when I arrived. Had lunch and breakfast at the restaurant located on the water with a nice view of the Queen Mary. Food and service was excellent.Thanks for the wonderful review and comments. We are so happy you enjoyed the hotel and look forward to your return."
"This is a beautiful hotel! The staff was excellent and we had an awesome stay. I recommend renting the bikes and riding over the bridge to downtown Long Beach. The evenings with all the fit pits and torches lite are amazing. I will stay again!Thanks for the great review. We love that you loved it. Come back soon."
"I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did. I booked a room for me and my other half for valentines day, got us a kingsize bed with a water view, got to check in at around 5 but told they over booked and no longer had my room available, keep in mind i booked my room a month ago... i was givin a room with two queen size beds that felt like a full Bad start to my romantic plans, after getting to our room we decided to go eat at the hotel restaurant fuego where we were greeted with a rude host that said since we had no reservation we had to sit inside, we said that fine yoy can see the water from anywhere inside it seemed, then she says its 95 per person but didnt tell us why just handed us the menu and said its the valentine menu. Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that. Overall bad"
"nice and clean, comfortable bed, friendly staff. Traveled for business and just stayed for one night. Breakfast was simple and sufficient a Danish, cup of coffee and orange juice. They provided all basic necessities ...."
"its a great place to stay clean comfortable, clean fireplace n great service quite n close to town for dinning n shopping plumber dave"
"Good: Great value, excellent customer service"
"Bad: The shuttle to Disney was not direct. Good: Polite and knowledgable staff , great lobby and breakfast ."
"The staff was excellent and very friendly and the room and bathroom were extremely clean. The bed was comfortable and the breakfast was good. The location is close to restaurants, take out, and gas stations."
"Good: We loved our stay at this hotel. All the staff specially the people in the front desk were extremely nice. Our room was very clean. Bed was really comfortable. The pool area was very relaxing. We had the hotel breakfast twice and both days it was fresh and tasty. We were also able to see magic kingdoms fire work show from the outside of our room because it was facing the park."
"Bad: The breakfast is very repetitive, but still good. Good: I liked the 24/7 tea and coffee. I liked the front desk employees. I like that they try to help you out with anything you need."
"Good: It was a very comfortable hotel,everything was was great"
"Bad: No complaints or dislikes. Good: Quality vs price was fantastic. Check-in was very friendly and above reproach. Cleanliness, comfy bed, quiet, and your typical serve yourself breakfast. Couldn't have asked for more for the price."
"Good: We were made to feel very welcome nothing was to much trouble the staff are very good."
"Good: The personnel were exceptionally kind and helpful. I would definitely go there again and suggest it to my friends."
"Bad: The meat at breakfast was horrible. Cheap no taste and the yogurt was horrible to I can tell it was real cheap brand . Good: The reception was so nice she let me check in early and the room was very clean. My kids love the pool."
"Good: Confy place, good shower and great breakfast."

"Good: Love everything about my stay"
"Good: Breakfast was great!"
"Everything was great (clean, nice, free nice breakfast, 24 hr coffee, free wifi). The service was extra great. We forgot to turn off our carlights and they helped us immediately to get our day on the way."
"Our room was handicapped accessible yet was located in the most obscure corner of the building on the third floor as far from the elevators as one could get. Seems kind of strange. Check-in process was fast and smooth with no issues room was clean comfortable and everything we needed."
"Good: Great location, awesome breakfast and clean rooms!"
"Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend."

"Bad: Not enough supplies. Good: Everything"
"Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights. Suggestion: Put families with small kids on ground unit and that way we will all be comfort. Also requested early check in and wasnt assigned unit until 5 pm."
"Good: Everything was great!!"
"We have been staying at this hotel on and off for almost a year. The staff is friendly, and helpful. When we checked in our room was very clean. It even smelled good. Our room has new carpet and is very large compaired to some other hotels. It even has a patio! The housekeeping, front desk staff, and management are always available to accomidate our needs. We often times have to ask for a lot, as we are extended stay guests(GREAT deals on extended stays by the way!) The pool is very l...view morearge, and there is a sauna, lots of tables and chairs, and a pool table right in the pool area. I wanted to write this review to let the staff know how great they do, and let future hotel seekers give this hotel a try. It is a GREAT value.view less"
"I would not recommend anyone stay at this hotel in Eau Claire. None of the staff have any idea whats going on when you check in. I had this hotel resereved for my wedding guests and everything got screwed up. We were all charged different amounts for our rooms, even after we were assured that we would only be charged this one amount. And the only girl who knew what was going on got FIRED!!! The NON smoking rooms were very nice but the smoking ones were horrible. Also plan to check out ...view moreon time becaue they call you right at check out time!!

"A once very nice hotel to stay at, has fallen into serious decline. They are in major need of security-Problems: kids running in hall at 10:30 at night, teens/20somethings drinking beer and eating pizza sitting in side walk outside lobby entrance, skateboarders all over parking lot at all hours, Bum hanging around smoking area, Broken A/C on 3rd floor, Ice...

"Totally recommend this hotel to anyone Staff extremely helpful. Deshia is a exceptional employee. Went out of her way to make sure everything was satisfactory. If in vallego again I would definitely stay at Best Western Inn and Suites at Dscovery Kingdom, Vallego"
"The hotel was great and just a block away from Discovery Kingdom. They have a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the park and picks you up later. This will save you 25 a day in parking. The breakfast buffet was a great way to start your day. They have coffee and cold water for you at the lobby 24hrs so that is also a plus. The rooms are spacious with sofa beds and the staff is very friendly. This is a great value and an awesome place for a family trip."
"Free parking ! Very clean room and hotel. Friendly staff. We will definitely stay here again."
"I have stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn a few times. It has a very convenient location to the Raritan Center and many restaurant options. It is always clean and the staff is excellent. The hot tub is really hot."
"If you're in Edison for whatever reason, this is the first, last and only hotel to consider staying at. Free parking, free wifi, free shuttle, free treats in the lobby, and friendly staff, I have NO negative complaints about this hotel. I loved my stay here!"
"great"
"My kids loved the pool. I loved the hot tub and the fitness area. My kids really enjoyed breakfast. Convenient location. Close to the beach. Great for the price. I will be back again. The rewards program is a great perk!"
"The front desk man was very rude. If I didn't like the indoor pool I would never go back again. He was very arrogant and acted as if he didn't care if our stay was enjoyable. Told me false information and made it difficult for me to check in.They need to rehire a new front desk person if I ever see him again I'm turning the other way."
"Booked over the phone. Asked if they were pet friendly and the lady said yes. Drove 5 hours to get here and then be told no cats allowed. Would not cancel nor refund the reservation. Called my bank to stop payment and dispute the charge. Very unfriendly staff. Not a good experience"
"I visited this hotel about 6,7years ago, It was nice, not sure what happened now.I stayed in the family suite, it was horrible,, one of the bedrooms was so hot,it melted my hair products.. The stairwell smelled like urine and fish. The kitchen stove area was dirty, both restrooms were hot and grimmy.The front of the dresser drawers were falling... More"
"They were very friendly when I booked my 246.00 with tax a night kitchenette room for that price you would expect a nice room. NOT!!!

"Stayed for the weekend and the only thing I would change is that a free continental breakfast would be nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Harrisburg."
"We recently stayed at Days Inn, Apple Valley, Sevierville, TN for 4 nights and had no problems and if did staff took care off. Emily and maintenance man are the best as is the rest of the staff who are for the most part. Convenient location-close to everything and get what you pay for. We'll be back next year."
"We had a quick overnight stay here while traveling from Atlanta to Boston. At the end of a 12 hour day in the car, this was a great place to pull into! The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, the room was very clean, and the beds were super comfy. Bonus, they are pet friendly, and it can be hard to find a place that will take 2 dogs. I would definitely stay here again."
"This hotel met all of expectations. Great breakfast, good value and convenient location."
"A recent stay in early April 2016 was most enjoyable. The property is beautifully appointed, with cool, industrial, minimalist decor and an unbeatable location in South Beach. The rooftop pool is beautiful. Best of all was the staff: friendly, courteous. They went out of their way to make sure that our stay was memorable (honeymoon, same-sex couple). Will definitely return.... More"
"We stayed two nights here while in town to visit with our son that lives in the area. The hotel was excellent. Room was spacious, beds were comfortable and everything works correctly. Would definitely recommend.Hello Guest, Thank you so much for your kind review! We appreciate the recognition and are so happy you enjoyed your stay with us. It was a pleasure and we hope to see you again soon. Sincerely, Liz Lionberger General Manager"
"Alfonso has the best smile... Great way to start my day every morning as I head for the free coffee and breakfast. I've thoroughly enjoyed my stay here... Even the house keeping staff is friendly and helpful as well as the maintenence guys, especially Tonya and Linda who both introduced themselves to me. Kelly (don't know if I'm spelling his... More"
"This place was worse than terrible! I reserved my dad a room for a funeral and i have to say that it was the worst place I've ever seen! The place was beyond filthy and smelly! They didn't even try to hide the filth, my brother found bed bugs in his room and decided to leave! Bottom line, STAY AWAY!!!!"
"Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else."
"When I checked in the front desk staff was really helpful and nice they upgraded me rooms because they were out of 2 queen size beds and they let me know at check in so when I went into the room the beds were so big my kids loved it because they had a big bed and the room was... More"
"One room key didn't work, carpets in hallway and at door filthy dirty, as for carpets in room, due to color, not able to see as much, but, come on, if outside door is visibly stained and dirty, what's expected inside. Continental breakfast ok. All night, as we checked in late, people,guests outside smoking and littering their cigarette butts all over. Don't recomend!"
"I have never been to such a place in my life. The room needs a deep clean or totally revamped. Then we had noisy people in the next room. When I called the front desk the night receptionist did come to to tell them to turn the noise down but was ignored. We complained again only to be told that... More"
"Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"The room was big and bed comfortable. Everything else was bad. Dirty, no hot water. Poor TV reception. Spotty wifi. Moldy hallway. Dangerous neighborhood. Bkfst only for tour groups. Faucets poor condition. Couch stained and baggy. Rug stained. Hole in door screen. Road under construction. Etc. etc."
"We had a problem with our air conditioning in the air and they were unable to fix it so they moved us to a new room even though the hotel was completely booked. It was a great place to stay overnight and very close to the auto train. Great staff!"
"Colazione abbondante e con molta scelta. Camere pulite."
"The hotel staff was very helpful, especially traveling around the greater DC area and shopping and eating establishments."
"After stopping over for one night in another city on the way to Springfield and being very disappointed in that hotel (Super 8), I was tempted to cancel my reservations here, but when we checked in, we were all pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with the rooms - very clean, helpful and polite staff, good hot/cold breakfast, etc. I had reserved two rooms (myself husband and in-laws). We checked in Tues and out on Sat - no problems at all. We would definitely stay at this hotel again."
"Excellent, clean hotel with great, included breakfast and friendly, helpful staff."
"The room was good and on the opposite side of the highway and low (2nd floor) as we heard others say something about the highway noise. The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC."
"We had a wonderful time! The breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Only downside was the elevator was broke for 2 days of our stay but glad we were only on the 4th floor. The free shuttle to the metro was awesome and saved us so much in parking and the hassle of DC traffic. The room was clean and housekeeping provided our needs in necessities."
"No desk or desk chair. No Internet except for rooms close to office. Air conditioner very loud. Uncomfortable bed."
"The employees there are so helpful! Breakfast was great, little different everyday. And with the shuttle to the metro, transportation was a breeze! Never had to wait for anything! We will go back and tell others about this wonderful hotel"
"I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything."
"The hotel staff, Ms. Vundee (I think this is how you spell her name) was an excellent hostess/ waitress in the breakfast room, she made the experience worthwhile. She was the only one who was very welcoming, cheerful, informative, caring in general a very good leader (she deserves a raise). The others in the front desk were average. The full breakfast was good with many options!"
"Hotel bien situe dans, pres de la ville de Washington et a proximite de la route pour se rendre dans les etats du Sud."
"This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. It is clean and very pleasant. We definitely will return."
"FIrst, the young woman who works at the front desk should get a raise. She was one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have met. She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience."
"Room was very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a plus and good. Close to highways (only 20 minutes from DC attractions. Nearby to shopping and local restaurants. The Silver Diner nearby was excellent."
"I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again."
"Very comfortable beds, nice linens. We used the mini refrig for cold waters and drinks. Great Breakfasts!! Friendly, helpful staff."
"Hotel was very clean. Staff was friendly and knowledgable. A lot of nearby shopping centers."
"The rooms, service, location, staff, and breakfasts were perfect. And the pool was unbelievably enticing despite its (or maybe because of its) unusual location!"
"Rooms are small, but staff is very accommodating. A good jumping-off place for commuting into DC"
"Very clean, near DC. Breakfast very good. Easy to locate, staff was friendly. Only I did not have time to try the pool."
"Location is unsafe and hotel looks pretty old. I used to stay at Best Western but I do not recommend anyone to stay here."
"Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!"
"Hotel was clean and neat. Rooms are wll kept, they have all the necessities that you would need. mornings get crowded at the continental breakfast. Staff very pleasant. overall a good experience."
"We stayed for 5 nights, and we were extremely pleased. It's not a new building, but it is well maintained. What we were most pleased about was the breakfast buffet! It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August."
"nice hotel, good security, little parkig, full thu-sun"
"We stayed for 3 days over the Memorial Day weekend 2015. This was a good hotel. Great location and very convenient to the Metro train. They have a REAL, full breakfast selection which was great..! We would definitely stay there again in a heartbeat."
"It's like any other hotel at this class but the staffs were friendly , room was clean full break-fast plenty of food and drink , the shuttle service to and from subway(metro) is free anytime you like , it's worth the cost of hotel fare. I would recommend for quests who like to spend not much but want more amenities or service this is the right hotel to choose ."
"I had to request a room change because the initial room was not able to get wi-fi access (Room 405). We were allowed to move to Room 128 where it worked. The hotel was clean and up-to-date. Very pleasant. The breakfast bar was the best one we encountered on the entire trip. In fact, I can say of the five motels/hotels we stayed in on our trip -- in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- this one was the best."
"Complimentary breakfast is offered which is great when you're on a family trip. Located near the metro station and with many restaurants and stores in the surrounding area."
"great location, great price, nice pool, ongoing upkeep apparent, best breakfast with many food choices, free parking"
"It was overbearingly awful. The humidity and the foul mold odor was over our heads. Thank God we only stayed one night, but seriously this hotel either needs a demolition or remodeling."
"Very nice staff and shuttle bus for anything within 3 miles. Excellent breakfast. 2 blocks to get to any expressway, The Silver Diner was great. Great value for the bucks."
"Fantastic buy for the money. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was OK with waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc. The place has been remodeled and updated, but we found the imperfections to be few and small. The travel service to the Metro station was quick, which was very important since we stayed there for 4 days."
"Everything about this hotel is geared to the DC business traveler. Nothing is missing from the standpoint of communications inclusive of wireless net access. They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way."
"For the rate it was an amazing stay! Would definitely recommend to my friends!"
"The breakfast each morning was really quite good. A lot of food and a lot of choices - not just carbs. Also, the shuttle that takes your from the hotel to anywhere within 3 miles was extremely valuable. We got to see DC and paid much less than average per night because the shuttle allowed us to go to the Metro every day, We also used the shuttle to go to restaurants for dinner, pick up a rental car for one day, and even church on Sunday"
"I was kicked out just 2 hours into my stay even though I paid full price thanks to the front desk people who gave out my information to an unknown third party. my safety and security was violated. I also saw cockroaches and bugs crawling all over the place. it was nasty."
"They should change a carpet in the room plus painting"
"after reservation the clerk refused to check my workers because they did not had a credit card at the time and refused to get my info the person that book the hotel for the requirement credit hold."
"The staff was remarkable. I was only there 2 nights, and in that short time 3 different people went out of their way to make sure I had what I needed. Absolutely superb staff! I'm a frequent traveler, and your people made this a very enjoyable experience."
"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)"
"We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again."
"The staff was very helpful in all aspects of service and provided our family with very helpful service to all the local venue"
"One of the most enjoyable stays. Everything was excellent."
"Excellent adventure. Room was clean and comfortable. Pool. Clean and maintain. Staff friendly. Close to food, shopping and trans. Staff made us feel comfortable and special. Will be back"
"Driving through and location was perfect. Hotel was very clean, bed was comfortable, rooms were quiet, breakfast was fresh and well maintained. Fitness room was the best I have been in yet at a hotel. Would totally stay here again."
"I stay here whenever I am in the area. It is amazing and consistently amazing from staff to physical plant. Very quiet at night and in the morning. The beds are so comfortable!. Very clean. Breakfast is always wonderful!!"
"I look for cleanliness when I stay at a hotel. I have no complaints. The room was clean with nice furniture, the bed was so comfortable. All of the staff were friendly and professional with smiles on their faces."
"Overall this is a nice hotel. However I did encounter a group of rowdy cheerleaders who were Loud. I had to complain each night about the noise but it was handled. Rooms were clean and Comfortable. I would stay here again. Sometimes you just have to complain if your stay is Unpleasant. I was compensated for my inconvenience."
"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel! From the staff to the food to the cleanliness of the rooms, this is a wonderful place to stay! It's a convenient location surrounded by several great restaurants and minutes from the mall."
"Due to an unexpected ice storm in Maine, we needed to leave a day early. Not only did this hotel take us in a day early, they let us into the room at 10 instead of 3! The food we brought along for our Coast Guard son survived! The hotel staff was amazing, helpful and courteous. The room was spotless, NO BED BUGS!!. The hotel is located close to Walmart, many nice eateries, shopping. 15 min from Newark, an hour or so from Virginia Beach and 5 min from the Coast Guard Base. Thank you so much for making our stay in Suffolk, Virginia. We will certainly be staying there in June when our son graduates A school! Thank you!"
"Desk Associates were very friendly, room was nice and clean, very quiet hotel. Slept like a baby. Thanks for the great stay."
"The hotel is well worth the extra money! Excellent staff, the facilities are very nice, and it's well located. 35 minutes from the beach in one direction 35 minutes from Williamsburg/Busch Gardens in the other direction. The staff was spot on. When we checked in, we needed linens for the pull-out bed. By the time I was able to unload my car, they were there waiting on the bed!"
"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!"
"Our single bed unit was updated and nice quality. Good TV, sofa, chair with ottoman. Two bar stools at a nice granite counter top. First day we received a phone call from maintenance that our tub has a leak and we would need to change units. Not happy but what can you do Doug went out of his way to... More"
"This is the 6th time we have stayed at WW. This stay was for 2 wks and we are well pleased. The setting is magnificent and the staff so very helpful. many thanks to Rose for all the personal assistance she gave us. The movie selection is great and Sundae night is fun"
"First we booked the hotel using hotels.com it had 2 stars which was fine since we just needed a quick place to sleep so we could go back to universal studios in the morning. We were not expecting much but what we got was so much worse. When we went to check in we had to give them an extra... More"
"The people a extremely polite and the room service was perfect. rooms and bathrooms were spotless."
"Very nice hotel with the exception of the bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable."
"Perfect hotel! Indoor pool, Hot tube, clean, comfortable, staff was friendly. It is located across from a shopping center with great restaurants and a movie theater...the beach was about 35-40 mins away which took me by surprise because under researched it...but I didn't seem to mind the drive. Overall I would recommend it to anyone."
"The hotel was great. We drove in and our room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed room service and the staff was great. Will stay here again when in Suffolk."
"My hotel stay at the Hilton Garden Inn can only be described as over the top excellent. I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn. I will ALWAYS make it a point to stay at this hotel each time I visit family in the area."
"Looking forward too returning again. Hopefully sooner rather than later."
"the hotel boasts one of the most comfortable beds I have had the pleasure of sleeping on. Also, a well appointed room all around."
"This hotel is located in a quite area. Within the location of this hotel it offers awesome stores options if you are in need of additional clothing or grocery store items. I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area. We went for coffee in the breakfast area, but the coffee seemed to have included undesired coffee grinds, we then chose to go out for breakfast after notifying the staff."
"I was very happy. We needed dinner and a quick night's sleep. The area was great and we had many choices for food. Kind of odd there are no glasses in the room, just two foam coffee cups."
"Our stay was wonderful.The room was clean,we had plenty of towels.The staff was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel ."
"Nice, clean and quiet. Staff were friendly and helpful. Great place to stay!"
"Stayed during high season in Phoenix. Not super chi-chi, but super solid. Impeccably clean room, clean lobby, clean grounds. Friendly staff. Cheesecake Factory walking distance a bonus. :-) Easy to get to from Phoenix ingress on Highway 60 from East. Great."
"The location of the Charlottesville Hyatt Place is excellent with a variety of food in walking distance. University of Virginia very accessible from this location. Front desk offered directions and guidance."
"Excellent location on the fringes of an up-scale shopping area and lots of restaurants within walking distance, just off Rt 29/250 By Pass. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with couch and chairs for lounging. The eating area provides a well appointed free breakfast and was perfect for gathering off-hours for a drink from the bar/Starbucks. The staff was bright and... More"
"All of the out of town family and friends attending the wedding stayed at the Hampton. The service was great and we especially appreciated the ability to gather as a group each evening in the breakfast seating area without any complaint."
"Here on business and there are limited choices, so I decided to try this because of the ratings. I arrived and checked in and my door was unlocked. Fingerprints, stains and hairs. This is surface cleaning, so the thought of what hasn't been deep cleaned in a while is scary."
"I had stayed here for my girls night birthday celebration and I must say the room was very spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very pleasant and all the amenities we needed were right in this room. I will definitely be using this hotel in the future"
"IT WAS A PLEASURE TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL. VERY CLEAN FRIENDLY STAFF. There was construction at this site initiative done a better job cleaning the area outside not leaving everything this laying outside it was not very pleasant to see."
"We were greeted with smiles and the hokey pokey. Every effort was made to ensure we had everything we needed. A nice soft bed to sink into after an afternoon of workshops. Snacks were available, a dream come true for hungry teachers."
"My wife and I flew in for the big game (UNC vs DUKE) to find that we arrived to early for check in. With me not even asking the General Manager (Patrick) made some calls and got us a room clean immediately. Not only was he working the front desk all by himself but we watched this man service every... More"
"Our room was clean and the check in process efficient. It is a very well kept property. But, the most outstanding thing about this Hampton Inn is PATRICK DEWBERRY! He's the main administrator at the front desk and his personalized service is bar none! He knows his guests and enjoys kibitzing with them - he has an incredible memory and... More"
"Very impressed with the customer service at this Hampton Inn - Patrick, the manager, was incredibly helpful in coordinating my travel through Chapel Hill. The receptionist, Sean, was incredibly kind and welcoming especially after a long day of travel. The room was in great condition and very clean. Hot breakfast and free wifi were great bonuses. Would book here again... More"
"Excellent accommodations. Clean spacious rooms and nice amenities. I am in Chapel Hill regularly and will definitely be returning. The staff was great. Even gave me a tip for a nice Thai restaurant-Bangkok 54- across the way. Excellent hot breakfast too!"
"This hotel is easy to find, and the staff is very accommodating . It is very close to a great neighborhood restaurant. It is very well taken care of. If you stay you will not regret it. I have stayed in a variety of rooms and including the suites and they are clean and comfortable."
"The best!! Everything about our trip was excellent! We liked the place so much we added a few extra days!! The breakfast was so good and different each day. The rooms were beautifully decorated and clean and comfortable. Slept like a baby!"
"I have enjoy my stay at the quality in. It was very quiet and I slept like a baby. The room was very clean and bed was comfy. The shower was very clean with hot water. Big flat screen tv and microwave and refrigerator. The brakefast they had was yummy. Very friendly staff. What I have to say is I... More"
"We stayed here on our way out to a Midwest trip and it was very unsatisfactory. The pillows were down, which I am extremely allergic to. I tried calling the guest service who didn't answer, twice. Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub."
"We stayed here on our way East. The room included a a balcony and a Jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable. The food and room service were exceptional. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful."
"Check in process went very smooth, Romano was very friendly and had a lot to offer as far as getting into DC and things to do. The room was clean, beds made nicely, bathroom was a bit small and only 2 large towels so we had to ask house keeping for more, the on duty house keeper didn't speak very... More"
"We recently moved to the DC area and needed a place to stay while house hunting. We chose the Red Roof Inn Plus based on a recommendation from our Bring Fido App since we were traveling with two dogs. The Red Roof Inn does not charge a pet fee, which is an added bonus, and it is Smoke Free! We... More"
"Was traveling. Had been driving all day. Went to this Hotel, was so very pleased. The staff at front desk was professional yet friendly. The rooms were clean and bright. The bathrooms were spotless. (im sort of picky) Complimentary coffee in Lobby. Fresh Cookie upon arrival. Comfortable beds, nice pillows. Will stay again."
"Front desk attendant wasn't available on arrival. Had to call her to open the door to let me into the hotel itself- that was a first for me. Then she proceed to be rude through out the check in process. AC was loud as a lawn mover. Kept me up all night. Worst one night stay ever. Big nope."
"My visit to Hampton Inn Jackson, Tn was an awesome experience !! The customer service I received from the associates named Rufus Tonie were exemplary and at the highest standards of customer satisfaction. Everyone on staff went over above to make sure my stay was an excellent experience. I will definitely be staying at this location again."
"Nothing bad to say about this hotel. Great location, great service, great staff, great rooms! And they take pets! The front desk staff was very helpful and so courteous. The last time we were in Jackson we stayed at the Marriott Courtyard next door and their service and the attitude of their front desk staff was so terrible we vowed... More"
"My hotel stay met my expectations. Just a good night's rest and quite place to stay. Service was good and room was clean. The breakfast meal was well done and food was hot and selections were many. the to go bag was handy for the early departure."
"Very clean room. Good breakfast. Extremely friendly and helpful front desk staff. The swimming pool is tiny and outdoors, but we didn't use it anyway. This is the best hotel in Jackson TN. We will stay here again."
"this is my first time feeling compelled to write a good review... The room was perfect... fireplace, jacuzzi tub, extremely comfortable bed and bedding! I am very picky but could not find anything to complain about! The owners were avail and even called us on our way to get eta so room would be perfect including rose pedals on the... More"
"My husband and I celebrated our 1st anniversary and stayed at The Inn at Europa. Up on a hill overlooking the vineyards took us to another place far away. It was beautiful. Chef Dean and his wife Nicole were very gracious and welcoming. Our room was very clean and comfortable and the staff was very professional. Chef Dean served us... More"
"Chef Dean and Nicole are amazing! They made us feel welcome from the moment we walked into the Inn. Our room was excellent and the balcony view was great! The breakfasts were incredible. We plan on returning to Europa again very soon!!"
"What a wonderful experience for a girls get away. Chef Dean and Nicole were great hosts. Breakfast was an international, yummy delight. Each room was different and very comfortable. The beds were conducive to a great night's sleep. We will be returning for our annual fall get away. Thanks so much Chef Dean an Nicole."
"What a find! We two couples were looking for an overnight stay in Temecula and hit the jackpot. Met Chef Dean early in the day and he made wonderful recommendations for a place to have lunch and a number of wineries to visit. In the afternoon we enjoyed drinks on the patio and then went to dinner at an Afghani... More"
"We have eaten at many other McMenamins before so for my son's birthday we chose the one in McMinnville since we were there for a track meet at Linfield. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Order was screwed up with two meals not delivered until everyone else was through waiters changed in the middle, and the bill charged us one meal too much. Not happy."
"The place to meet after a long day at UFOfest. I had a very tasty burger with all the trimmings and tried some imaginative beers. Great atmosphere is half the journey to a good meal experience. Try the roof top on a sunny day, relax and watch the clouds go by."
"We were passing through McMinnville on our way to the coast. Thought we would stop for a quick breakfast and be on our way To our surprise we stayed for breakfast and lunch!! The food was excellent, staff exceptional and the location really invites you to linger and investigate. The rooftop bar is so unexpected, relaxing and cool!! Really... More"
"My Son took me here while I was on vacation. We ate on the top deck and had a very good meal. Our hostess was awesome and I will definitely go back. We did walk the streets after dark and it was cool to see all of the architecture downtown."
"Upon Arrival, I was greeted warmly by Ashlee at the front desk. She knew my first name and that we were there for our daughter's weddding! What a difference from the previous two nites we had spent at the Torrey Pines Hilton.I will review that hotel as well.... For me, it is all about service, and I was so impressed... More"
"My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week."
"Located in the sleepy town of Westfield, this Best Western was exactly what it was intended to be. It's a no frills, business orientated hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast punctual and delicious, the staff incredibly accommodating and courteous and the location central. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any business travelers."
"The staff at Westfield Best Western was very helpful, courteous and accommodating. I stop here whenever I'm in the Westfield, NJ area. The service and price is great, walking distance to great eateries and a French Restaurant right next door! Always a pleasurable stay! You won't be disappointed. The staff go out of there way to accommodate. Kudos to the... More"
"Nice location and convenient to the beach. The property is pretty old and outdated. The room had to many cockroaches. Cockroaches were on the desk and in the furniture. Would be nice if the rooms were pest free."
"My family and I really enjoyed staying at The Kahala. Overall stay was relaxing, welcoming and pampered. The staff were wonderful providing great service. Love the beach as it felt private and peaceful.Mahalo for staying at The Kahala, we are delighted you enjoyed your stay and the peaceful beach. We look forward to welcoming you back soon."
"I came down for a work event, and I chose this hotel mainly for its proximity to the event site, but I ended up having dinner at the restaurant on the 11th floor, which offered great happy hour and fantastic views. It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal."
"Such a good trip. Being there with my fiancee to enjoy a little getaway for the weekend was perfect. We couldn't believe the view. The sunset was phenomenal and you can't imagine the sunrise. I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool. I guess that's where the extra income from the paid wifi goes too Whatever. It was sweet. We loved it and loved how friendly the staff was. They truly care about you and are always ready to help."
"It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help."
"Our stay at the Crowne Plaza in downtown Columbus was fantastic. The front-desk staff were kind and helpful. The lobby was sleek and modern. Our room was very clean and very well-lit--- which is very important when you're studying for the bar exam or doing work. The bathroom was very clean. The beds were comfortable. I loved the city views... More"
"Love this hotel. Clean, great location and friendly staff! Hotel bar has great food also. We look forward to staying here and have done so for the last 4 years. About 10 minutes from Columbus Crew (now know as Mapfre Stadium) and close to the airport."
"The room was spotless. There was a relaxation pack (complimentary) that had relaxing room spray, scented lotion and a cooling, refreshing oil. The soap, shampoo and lotion in the bathroom were awesome. Check in was easy. Overnight valet parking was 24 but parking is expensive downtown. Front desk service was quick. Very pleased with the room and would definitely stay... More"
"I've been coming to conventions in Columbus for several years, this was my first time staying at The Crowne and it is by far superior in all ways. My experience started before check-in. I required special handicap accommodations, so I called the hotel directly to be sure that a couple of things could be prearranged for my room. I asked... More"
"We booked a wedding block for a group attending a near-by celebration. (Thank goodness the hotel wasn't the wedding venue). From check-in to check out, the experience was a fiasco. Guests didn't get the right rooms, rooms weren't made up room amenities (like shampoo and toilet paper) were non existent and took staff over an hour to bring restaurant was... More"
"Avoid. Nothing good to say. The list goes on and on. Beds not made, no toilet paper, botched room assignments, mixed-up special events. The parking lot has recently been re-paved, everything else is broken. Something is wrong at the top here as evidenced by the total disorganization."
"Not only was this a beautiful property but the whole staff: the valet, front desk, sales, food and beverage, A/V Internet departments were so helpful. Even when I screwed something up, they helped me make it look seamless. The food was excellent and the room worked perfectly. Sleeping rooms are beautiful. Ok, the wireless internet speed could of been... More"
"The room was small but very comfortable. Beautiful area with lots shopping!"
"My husband, son and I stayed here for three nights last minute. We got to the hotel and the man at the front desk was completely helpful with getting us a room. We got to the room and it was so clean and comfortable so we were quite pleased with that. We had a slight view of the dock which... More"
"We had an excellent time. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our rooms and the hotel were very clean. My wife is the type who lifts the sheets and mattress pad to check the mattress. The breakfast they give every morning is excellent. The eggs and breakfast meat changes every morning and there is three kinds of cereal, coffee,... More"
"This hotel staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable and satisfied with your stay there. We've come here many times and will continue to because they make us feel welcome. We could have stayed nearby at other hotels but we prefer how this hotel is r4un by the management."
"We stay at this hotel when ever we get a chance to go to Jupiter. There are a lot of fancier hotels in Jupiter that cost a lot more money but I would still prefer to stay at this hotel. It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. They are in a fantastic location that is convenient to... More"
"Great stay!"
"Dirty rooms. Outdated decor. Faulty lights. Bad odor. Terrible breakfast. Would not recommend or stay here again. Disgusting."
"We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again."
"Great hotel, great staff"
"The manager that night was excellent."
"The hotel was very clean and the room was comfortable. Off the main drag so there wasn't a lot of traffic noise. The only downfall is that there isn't a continental breakfast. They did have a cupboard where you could purchase food and other items which helped out."
"great."
"Very nice! Accesability of bathroom was well thought out. As a handicapped person I can ALWAYS tell when the design of a space was done by a non handicapped person."
"I find that Candlewood Suites offers an excellent stay for the price. It is better much than a lot of more expensive hotels. The hotel is always very clean. It offers the best in creature comforts and each room is very well organized for business travel."
"Target, Wal-Mart, food establishments are in walking distance. The airport is 10 mins away and the shuttle is always available. The property is brand new, every inch of the suite/room was magnificent with the marble in the bathroom. I washed clothes (complimentary wash/dry). Loved it. Workout room has all the up-to-date equipment. Front desk hospitality from beginning to end of my stay. I'm from Los Angeles/Orange County, California, and a very neat and clean person. I will most definitely be back. The drive to Virginia Beach is very close, freeways are right at the location. Highest recommendation and respect for this hotel."
"This hotels is great ! The staff is always courteous and kind and go out of there way to help you and your family . On my sons birthday they went out and brought him a balloon to say Happy Birthday !!!"
"This Hampton Inn location was easily accessible and well kept. We enjoyed our nice comfortable rooms. The bathrooms were clean and the room as well as the hotel had a nice clean smell that reassured cleanliness. We would definitely consider staying at this property again."
"Very nice hotel. Staff was very friendly, rooms were very nice and comfy, continental breakfast was good. Only thing that I would change would be to have some benches or seating outside. All in all nice motel."
"Stayed at the Hampton Inn and I must say, everything was awesome! My room was cleaned beautifully and actually smelled fresh! The staff here is really great polite, friendly, helpful - great customer service. All in all, a truly positive hotel experience."
"We always try and stay at Hampton Inn . This is our first stay at this one and it is the best yet. Clean. No smoking. We had 4 rooms and every one was really nice with great beds and linens. Staff was awesome. ..every single person . Will absolutely stay here again."
"We really needed this weekend get away to visit our daughter and to get some rest. The hotel staff was pleasant and breakfast was the best meal but they had healthy choices. The hotel was clean and quiet. The workout room had enough equipment to get a good workout. The shopping malls was walking distance as well, if you enjoy... More"
"Nice place to stay. Very quiet. Even with outside temps around 40's the pool area was in the 70's and water was relaxing. and of course those late evening cookies are a nice touch as well. Breakfast was always ready at 6:00 and also has those Breakfasts To-Go-Bags if youre in a hurry."

"It's for our weekend get away, and it was a pleasant stay at Homewood Suites. Will go back there."
"Our party of 4 adults and 1 child had plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable in the spacious 2-bedroom suite. Friendly, courteous staff. Excellent amenities, including executive putt-putt course, TV club room, 24-hr convenience shop, and business center. Good breakfast and complimentary internet was a plus. An all-around pleasant hotel stay."
"My family loved this hotel. Good continental breakfast and free dinner on weekdays. Kids enjoyed the indoor pool. Room is large , clean and has central air instead of those loud a/c units. The only negative for me was that the bed was too hard."
"All the kids enjoyed the nice size pool, comfy beds, and great breakfast. We had a blast and there was more than enough room to get our just dance 4 groove on! Can't wait til next year:)"
"Felt like home. Would definitely stay here again. Great free breakfast! Very comfortable suites."
"Not only myself, but my family loved this hotel and we will return again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants good service as well as a nice, clean hotel stay:) The rooms were excellent and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and I loved the pool/jaccuzi and computer room. Onsite laundry is recommended as well as the room service. Great location as there were many restaurants nearby. If I could change anything, it would be the structure of the hotel room (to include more privacy for a family of four...door or divider). Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time!"
"Il s'agissait de notre troisieme experience a cet hotel et nous avons encore une fois ete tres bien servis et surtout tres bien recus. Si nous retournons en Virginie dans les prochaines annees, nous ne chercherons pas ailleurs."
"The staff and hotel were great. I would stay here again."
"Excelent hotel very clean, great for families,couples or single persons will difenitely stay there agian hotel was worth every dollar spent on"
"Need a little more turkey items on the menu everyone doesn't always eat pork."
"Neighborhood is quite dicey and not close to anything. The front desk clerk acted like I was bothering him when I checked-in and did not invite us to the complimentary afternoon happy hour or explain breakfast availablilty. The cleaning staff did a very good job when they bothered to show up. The room was beautiful and included full-size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all the utensils and dishware that we could have needed. Washer and dryer for guest use on 1st floor. DOG friendly!"
"AC died in the house...used my Hilton honors rewards to get a great rate. The general manager personally called to make sure our stay was going well. Fantastic service from all."
"The staff was very friendly and helpful, responding quickly to requests. The facilities were comfortable and clean and we appreciated the little snack on arrival. Breakfast was tasty with good options."
"Nous avons passe une tres belle semaine a cette hotel, tres propre, personnel courtois, belle chambre il manque rien, 20 min. de la plage les dejeuner etait correcte."
"Our experience at the Homewood Suite was very good. The hotel was very clean. The room we had was very spacious, it accommodated 4 adults 2 children and a puppy. We are very very happy in our choice to go with the Homewood Suite .. Our next trip to Virginia we will stay at the Homewood Suite."
"The staff was top notch. From the desk manager to the cleaning ladies everyone was friendly and eager to help. Great attitudes. The WiFi was slow and eventually just turned back to 4G. The Breakfast was a get there early thing but it was free. The rooms were not new but everything was clean. And you had a good choice of walk to live music from the hotel."
"terrible staff was hateful air condition didn't work and the rooms were not cleaned"
"Room was a little scary. Someone or something had been locked in the bathroom, it was all scratched up and grimy. Ewww."
"the Ramada is a great place to stay away from home. I travel for work and need a clean and affordable place to sleep. I bring my wife when we come to Naples because of the clean and quiet settings .. I will always stay here when I come for work or relaxation. Karl the Chairman 561-596-5165"
"We have stayed at the Tarpon Inn Dozens of times over the years with the latest being Valentines Weekend. It is a historical site for sure. The rooms are all decorated differently with vintage photos from the area. The small swimming pool is great to dive into after a day on the beach or fishing. It is also very close... More"
"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is in an excellent location - waterfront- right near the downtown Dunedin action. I would recommend staying here. The hotel has a bar and restaurant, waterfront view, great parking, great views"
"Do not stay here!!! THIS IS THE WORST! I had a horrible experience. The hotel is smells like fish. Their is a swamp located outside the door that you enter your room. Management does not call you back when you have problems. I had to call the corporate office in order to get a call back from them.The tub got... More"
"Well this was a surprise find, wonderful location, Marina view to our front and Harbour view to our back, the restaurant and bar were first class, good service and helpful staff.

"I enjoyed it"
"We had an amazing time. The hotel was a perfect place for us. And, every staff person we came in contact with was outstanding! We plan on going back."

To cope with the situation, I began contacting hotels/motels in the Lawton-Fort Sill area on December 29th.

"Amazing hotel! Great location! Starbucks and lots of restaurants were right down the road. The hotel has been newly renovated so everything is nice and new. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The only thing I didn't like was that housekeeping came by at 9am. A little too early in my opinion. But overall I give this place 5 stars!"
"Calm environment, great breakfast, helpful staff."
"We were on a family trip and had an unexpected overnight. Pulled up, walked in, were treated well, and check in was a breeze. The pool facility was nice, the room was clean and nearly brand new. The breakfast was everything you needed. The parking lot felt safe and have 0 complaints or concerns about this property."
"We only stayed for one night, but I think would have been very happy had we needed a longer stay. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The lobby area and our room was very clean. While we didn't use the kitchen area because our stay was short and we were out of town for most of the day, everything... More"

"We stayed here when going to Pittsburgh for an event at Duquesne University. We love this hotel because of its proximity to Duquesne and downtown.

"Would be happy to give 6 stars if I could. Outstanding in every way. Service is the stand out. Everyone was exceptional. The room was very nice and the bed was the coziest ever. Food was great! Wish the door that connects the adjoining room was better. Better locks and a heavier door would be appreciated. Otherwise, all was really... More"

We were able to get back from the game in only... More"
"Stayed here to attend the Penquins/Sharks game. It is right across the street from Consol Energy Center. The valet was very informative about area restaurants and when to go to avoid hockey game crowd. The bellman was also helpful and gave us a coupon for a free appetizer from a bar across from center. He was very well dressed, we... More"
"Room is a little bit spendy at close to 200/night but it's a nice big room with a desk and a couch. Looks like a junior suite but it doesn't have the 2nd TV in front of the couch. If there's a negative it's that you can hear some traffic noise outside the windows. Get a higher floor to mitigate.... More"
"Other than being told on hotels.com that breakfast was included in our cost, but it wasn't, the stay was wonderful. We will be back. For being so close to the airport, no plane noise!!!!"
"I had a terrible experience with this hotel. I did not have towel rack or telephone in my room. Also there was an issue with the cleanliness of the room."
"Bad experience. Most of the employees live at the hotel. Lady bartender was great but apparently the system in the restaurant went down all weekend so no food and very inconvenient to leave hotel to get food as the hotel is tucked way off in an industrial park. Room stank like feet, bathroom had stains on the wall, light fixtures nearly falling off the wall, carpets were very stained. Overall horrible hotel"
"Stay in Pittsburgh was great. The location was very close to all the places we wanted to go. Room was perfect. Pool was a little small. Breakfast was ok I do not think the staff could keep up with the rush in the morning."
"From the front desk to the maintenance folks, these folks are all about customer service. I identified myself as a night worker when I checked in. Working 13-14 hours per night, the last thing I wanted to do was come to a dirty room or be awakened by the housekeeping a inevitable knock on the door. The staff made sure... More"
"This is a great place to stay. I have been going there for 7 years and will not stay anywhere else. The staff treats you just like family when you show up. Deny always has a smile on her face no mater how late my arrival. Sylvia and her team have been taking great care of not only me but... More"

"I am not sure who wrote the reviews on this place nor when they were written. evidently they have not been there recently. The outside looks very good but, beware!

"Had a weekend visit at a church in the area - and had a very nice stay at this motel. The accommodations were clean and no problems to report. A little older property, but overall a very nice place to stay. Thanks!"
"I agree with everybody that rated this hotel low. It is pretty bad my wife did not feel safe and the room had a musty smell. Staff was ok but location and people around was scary. We ate our dinner and promptly left. Did not even bother try to get our money back."
"good location, is clean, seems safer, no people hanging around the parking lot anymore. is close to downtown. although the motel6 liess than a mile away is cheaper, not sure why, but overall the motel is good place to stay."

There was evidence of cockroaches in the room and bed linen had seen better days, very old and grey. There was debris from some rooms lying outside the cabins which could be a trip hazard although the car park/yard... More"
"The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted. The rooms are poorly cleaned with light bulbs burned out and never replaced. Staff consists of young children that cannot make decisions nor are mature enough to deal with challenges."
"This hotel was wonderful. I stayed with friends and we had a great nights rest which we all really needed. It was the most spacious and beautiful hotel room that I think I have ever had. It was clean (actually the room smelled wonderful, as did the towels!) The bathroom was excellent. So many hotel rooms have poor lighting nowadays... More"

"We stayed here due to close proximity to where we were going. Online, it appeared to be the best of the 3 in this small town. We didn't expect a 4 or 5 star... But we did expect a clean place to catch some sleep. Fairly run down and I can understand that in a small town, but there's no... More"

"Hotel was easy to locate and very clean. Bed was not comfortable."

There are restaurants in walking distance, which means you don't have to drive to get a meal. Breakfast was nice! I recommend this, especially the price."
"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel on New Road. It was convenient to many places we wanted to go. Rooms were clean, quiet and the beds very comfortable. Great breakfasts and the staff was very hospitable."
"Nice hotel very friendly staff. Breakfast is pretty much standard. The only thing I would recommend is a bench in the front of the hotel. It has an indoor pool but we didn't take advantage of that. Flying J truck stop is right across the street it can get noisy on the west side at times."
"Loved the service from the front desk. We requested a room away from as many other guests as possible so as to create as little problem for them as possible. We are a large family ( 2 adults and 4 kids under 10 yrs old), and Bryan was great. He settled us in a room on the ground floor, as... More"

The restaurant is wonderful- we've enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner numerous times and have always been pleased. The location is perfect for exploring the city or neighboring islands."
"First rate staff and facility. We were ending a long and somewhat stressful trip, and this was a welcome place to unwind and recover. The staff truly could not do enough to make us comfortable. What a pleasure to be in a place where they use metal keys! No lockouts with a magnetic key after 2 or 3 days, as happens in other places. Coffee in the lobby, a newspaper at our door in the morning, and a wonderful whirlpool and sauna to unwind. Also, a fine fitness room."
"Had a wonderful stay here. My fiancee and I came for a weekend getaway. The staff was really helpful, the hotel is immaculate, the spa is a blast, and in the best part of Portland. We will definitely be back."
"The room, the beds, the food and the help at this hotel is nothing short of perfect without including a lot of extras my husband and I don't need. The location is close to everything and the building is historical and very well kept. Could not ask for a more homey place to stay."
"I'd never been to Portland for any extended time before and my boyfriend insisted the Regency Hotel was in the best location and I'd love it.

Room service was delicious and the... More"
"I have been going to Portland for years and I had never even seen this hotel (which has been there for many more years).

"Room was a bit small but staff excellence and great location equaled an awesome stay."
"My family was returning back to Iowa from spending a weekend in Door County WI. We enjoyed our overnight stay at the Appleton Fairfield. The front desk staff was more than accommodating by checking the temperature of the pool upon my wifes request. The room (118) was clean and smelled fresh great job by cleaning staff. The breakfast was warm... More"
"Beautiful room, ocean view, fridge in room, DVD player, balcony"
"I am quite pleased with the level of service with this resort, Upon arrival we walked into the lobby and it was very warm and inviting. The overall look of the resort is for pleasant and inviting. I could only imagine what it's like in the summer, but for a quiet winter-retreat it's a fantastic place to get-a-way for a... More"
"This review is for the weeks of Nov 9, 2015 and Nov 16, 2015. I stayed at this hotel to be close to a family member that was hospitalized at Stanford Medical Center. This hotel is managed very well and met my expectations. Excellent was the staff, comfort of the room, actually a very nice large TV, and overall cleanliness... More"
"I had great customer service at this hotel. I mistakenly clicked the book button twice and accidentally reserved two rooms. When I explained the situation to the manager he allowed me to only pay for one room even though they were booked up and as I arrived late at night they could not sell the other room they had waiting...

"Spent a week visiting Disney parks and stayed here due to a friend gifting us their Disney Vacation Club points. This resort, despite having construction at the pool closest to our villa, was top-notch. The staff members were courteous and helpful. The two bedroom suite with full kitchen and amenities was excellent, clean and well maintained. Our villa in The... More"
"I have traveled to Walt Disney World a number of times and will continue to travel there based on how outstanding every aspect of the resort is. When we arrived at Saratoga Springs we were welcomed by hotel staff and a wonderful display of holiday decorations. It was very beautiful and put a huge smile on everyone's faces! Now, on... More"
"We are DVC members for the past 3 years and have had great experiences before this trip in late November. We had almost 500 taken from our room during our one cleaning experience. We were not aware that the room was being cleaned on day 3 of our 9 day stay. We had our money out in plain view in... More"
"Just returned from a short break to another outstanding Disney Resort. Saratoga Springs is a huge resort so be warned. I used the Disney transport throughout my stay, to and from the airport and around the parks and other hotel resorts probably the longest wait was around 15 minutes the shortest 1 minute. I was in a 1 bedroom apartment... More"
"Recently stayed for 2 weeks in the Paddock area of saratoga springs. Great location..just a short walk to the paddock pool and padfock grill...also 2 mins from either carousel or paddock bus stop. Short and very pleasant 5 min walk to the main springs pool and artists pallete restaurant and main lobby. Pool was amazing..never over crowded. Room ..studio..was very... More"
"Originally we were at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter. Our room had a broken bed and we were not satisfied with it. The hotel manager then moved us to this resort. EVERYTHING about it was GREAT from the time we arrived. The front desk rep was extremely helpful even the manager who apologized over and over for the broken bed... More"
"We rented a two bedroom suite, as Florida residents. This was a very clean and well laid out for our family trip. The bedrooms were split to reach side of the common area, one being a king with hot tub and big bathroom. The other side had two queen beds with a second bath and we ordered a crib, while... More"
"This is one of the best employee and breakfast experiences you are going to get in the Lacey area. I have started to choose this over more opulent places if I am allowed to choose it for work. The staff are top-notch friendly and the breakfast is one of the best I've experienced."
"We had a wonderful week at the Best Western in Lacey. Each day they would have different breakfast foods which was great. The room was very comfortable, the only issue was the size of the pillows. I thought they were too small for a king size room. I asked about them, but that was all they had. We would still... More"
"We have spent a number of nights at this motel. It is always very clean, breakfast above average, friendly staff. When we checked out we mentioned how heavy the bed covers were. We were told we should have requested a lighter cover, as we were not the only ones to talk about this one problem. Great for cold weather. Not... More"
"When travelling to see family, we've taken to stopping near our destination the night before to give the kids the opportunity to swim and unwind from the long trip instead of showing up cranky and tired from driving. It has really worked out for us. Our 'normal' hotel had a problem with their pool, so we chose to stay at... More"
"WE stay here every time we come to Olympia. Great service, wonderful staff, very clean rooms, best breakfast we have found in our travels. Lots of stores around within walking distance. A ten minute drives to old town."
"This is a friendly, courteous, clean, comfortable hotel with a terrific breakfast. A 5-star family hotel that is also in a convenient location. We appreciated being able to open a window for fresh air. The king room is really comfortable and convenient with sitting area. Wifi worked smoothly. Looking forward to returning."
"We love staying at this hotel. It's close to a casino, food and has a great pool/spa for the kids. We choose to have weekend fun nights here - it's close to outdoor activities that we enjoy and the town of Lacy is super cute."
"Everyone on staff was great and continued to be helpful and just excellent customer service Breakfast bat crew also great"
"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary this past weekend. The hotel lobby was beautiful, clean and have a very welcoming vibe. The staff was extremely pleasant! Our room was clean, super cute and cozy. We had an adjoining room so we could hear the guest next door from time to time but it was not a bother what so ever. Overall our local get away was a much needed break from real life and this hotel provided the perfect space to relax, feel comfortable and enjoy the weekend."
"We will return. It was just wonderful. Customer service was very much on point."
"Everything was Wonderful until I saw that there was a Blood line on the side of the Tub... I told the Front Desk about it... Also We had to moved to another room because of Toilet Problems but I fount a Blood line at the other room.. I was contacted about it or Did anyone Higher the the Front Desk person Apologized to me and My family for anything.. Nor did I receive any type of discount.. I'm getting ready to stay there again... I Love it other than that Problem that We had... Thanks"
"At check in, the staff was most friendly and helpful. There only one night, my suite was clean and comfortable. Beds were very good (wimpy pillows though). Only negative was the noise of another's air conditioning unit running for hours. That type of noise should not be heard at all! Overall, I would recommend Springhill Suites!!"
"I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!"
"Staff were friendly, bed were comfortable, room was clean and had pretty decent complimentary breakfast. The only complaint was the cloudy and dirty indoor pool My kids and I were planning to do a morning swim but we're disappointed with the pool condition :("
"Yes, it was convenient and our expectations of a Marriott property that were well met. Our room was spacious and very adequate, and in fact exceeded our expectations. Henry Jones checked us in with cordial and competent ease. The evening was restful and uneventful, the breakfast was exceptional. It is a 4 star hotel."
"I forgot the name for the lady serving/putting-out breakfast but she provided excellent customer service and that's hard to find now-in-days."
"My stay with SpringHill Suites was amazing! Beautiful Suite, very clean, the staff was friendly and the breakfast was great."
"The hotel staff was wonderful. The room was comfortable and spacious. Good value."
"This was the nicest SpringHill Suites I've stayed at. Beautiful lobby and room, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the price was awesome for summertime. The airport shuttle was quick and efficient. The hotel was very clean. I'd definitely recommend you staying here."
"Pleasant and accommodating. It was the perfect rest stop while on business."
"Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!"
"nice accommodations, friendly staff"
"We have stayed there several times. Very comfortable and relaxing environment."
"This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great."
"Ausgezeichnetes Hotel. Sehr freundliches Personal. Wurde jederzeit wieder hier ubernachten."
"My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable."
"We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here."
"Friendly staff, clean comfortable room... Convenient location offering easy access to highway... The early morning breakfast was a nice pitstop before heading over to the hospital. I will make it a point to stay here again the next time I'm in town...."
"My son was coming home from Deployment. The staff was very helpful and very attentive to our family! Will definitely stay again :)"
"room layout is very ideal as kids slept on pullout and we had separated king bed. tv swivels both ways!"
"Oustanding hotel, clean and spacious. However, hotel cannot be found on GPS."
"Nice room, convenient kitchenette, great breakfast. A good stop-off for travelers."
"Was clean, comfortable and close to the hospital. I could not share in breakfast so a discount for us would have made us happier with the cost."
"We stayed only 1 night having a very late flight. The staff was extremely helpful. Our room was very nice and comfortable. Breakfast was really good. Lots of free parking. Great location. Would stay again."
"Great hotel. Clean and comfortable with a very good breakfast."
"loved it"
"Great looking and clean and friendly! Good value for the money and a nice part of town, too! Easy off and on the highway nearby. Lots of good places to eat very close by. Stayed nearby once before and glad we tried something different this time."
"Very nice and close to enerywhere I had to go"
"The room was very nice. I can't think of a way it could have been improved. The staff has pleasant and eager to please. I highly recommend this hotel."
"We were visiting our daughter and found this hotel online. It was conveniently located for the activities that we planned for the weekend."
"The staff were wonderful, always willing to help."
"Location, cleanliness, service great! Loved the pool and spa! Only problem was an extra charge on my debit card that they did not tell me about, will call and straighten it out tomorrow!"
"My husband and I decided to go down to Hampton for a weekend over Valentines Day. We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They were all very friendly and we got in real late on our first night and the check in process was smooth and stil friendly at 1:00am. I was glad to know that I was receiving the same service at 1:00am checking in as I would have during a normal check in hour. The room was so comfortable and clean. We loved our stay and it was close to all the near by attractions."
"easy check in, comfortable stay, friendly hotel staff, would definitely stay again"
"My first time here and I absolutely loved it!! We definitely will be coming back!"
"The rooms was excellent the breakfast was great with a very good price."
"The hotel beds were very comfortable, I slept like a baby."
"My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
"The hotel was decent and affordable. The info for restaurants in the area was very helpful. We went to a local spot which was more pleasant and less crowded. Very close to the intersate."
"5 star service and amenities at a 3 star price!"
"Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower."
"It was wonderful."
"Great stay, courteous staff, noon check out......perfect after a very long drive!"
"Will always stay here when we're in that area"
"This is a great hotel. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Checking in and checking out was very simple without any wait time. The hotel room was spotless along with the lobby and other facilities. I highly recommend staying here."
"We really enjoyed our overnight visit at the Hilton Garden. The staff was very attentive and my daughter and I felt like we were home. My only disappointment was that we had to pay for breakfast. It wasn't that great, and I felt that it should have been included."
"Overall great stay, staf is very nice and helpful! Shuttle bus on time and 24/7 so very convienient. Also the breakfast at 6 and if you need to go before that, they give you a breakfast baggie to go, very thoughtful! Close to the airport and to Jersey Gardens Mall! I would recommend this hotel and come back here for sure."
"My daughter and I stayed overnight here before her cosmetology state board test. Michelle fixed up a breakfast pack for my daughter since she would be leaving before the start of the continental breakfast was served. She asked for my daughter's preferences and delivered it to our room with a sweet note wishing her good luck! There are refrigerators in... More"
"We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!"
"Great place close to beach"
"The hotel staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The beds were comfortable and sheets were clean. Check-in was a breeze."
"We originally was staying at Super 8. But that hotel was very disgusting. So we stayed at Courtyard by Marriott. Very clean friendly. Will surely stay again highly recommend it to family friends."
"The property was very nice and very clean. The rooms are a nice size and are very clean. The food at all the restaurants was very good and the prices are what you expect to pay at a five star resort and not over inflated. The best part though is the staff. Every interaction we had with any staff member... More"
"My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for three nights while attending a wedding held at the resort. The wedding was beautiful and the staff and scenery was top notch. We attended the wedding during a busy time in our lives and yet we were totally relaxed upon entering the property!"
"Friends had told us that this resort was worth visiting, so we booked a five day visit in early March, 2016 and weren't disappointed. Rooms were wonderfully appointed (large wood beams, spacious bathroom and walk-in closet and balcony overlooking desert). Three restaurants to choose from at hotel (plus to go service if want a snack or light breakfast) and one... More"
"How to describe perfection Total elegance, super-attentive staff, adjacent to hiking trails from the hotel property, early morning/late night hot pooling, astronomic observation from the green, resident desert tortoises, on-site rangers, delicious drinks, sushi, golf (if that's your thing) and every amenity you can think of. We spent an amazing four nights (thank you Marriott points!) and can't wait to... More"
"I have no idea why this resort isn't on more people's radar. Maybe it's better that it isn't - but now you know the secret. It's located just far away from town that it feels secluded but not remote. The building is well laid out and nothing seems like it is too far. The property is perfectly maintained and appropriately... More"
"We were absolutely treated as you would expect...very high end experience with all the right amenities. Golf course is very challenging and cheap if you play in the summer (too hot for most, but get a cart and bring water and it's totally worth it). The rooms were exceptional (amazing views from this slightly perched location) and the service was... More"
"Build into to mouth of a desert canyon the hotel is structured and colored to fit in with the landscape. The two pools are wonderful as are the hiking trails and golf course. The food and cocktails are also excellent but the wine list could use some work. My favorite rooms are in the separate casitas -- more expensive but... More"
"We stayed here two nights and boy I wish it was more. Great fun for my kids 10,12. The service is fantastic! Mercy at the front desk couldn't do enough for us. I will definitely be coming back. We ate on property since there is not much around. Food was very good. My only issue was the pocket doors for... More"
"The service is outstanding. Every staff member regardless of their position went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating - and always with a smile. We booked a standard room using points, and were upgraded for free to a Casita suite. It was incredibly nice. The only negative was the AC unit was loud and creaky and caused... More"
"This is a lovely property. It would be ideal for a romantic getaway. But it was nice for business as well. The staff is very nice and very accommodating. It was not very busy considering it was February. This hotel is away from everything. You will eat and drink here the entire time unless you want to drive 30 min.... More"
"Amazing hotel for the price, the staff was very nice. I would definitely stay again if I need to. Close to places and the bed was very comfy."
"comfortable room. good air conditioning,Friday night stay in business park area, so very few guests. Price could have been under 100."
"Great access to transportation, major tourist attractions, and restaurants. Nearby mall is an added bonus."
"Very nice, very reasonable, very clean. Nice friendly staff"
"Excellent."
"Great, night sleep on nice, clean King size bed. Nice comfortable pillows! Room was large and very clean. Front desk staff was friendly. Free shuttle to/from National airport and to/from a nearby Metro station and complimentary, fresh breakfast buffet is a nice plus! Highly recommend this hotel."
"We enjoyed the hotel very much, particularly the free shuttle to/from the airport and metro station and to drop us at a restaurant for dinner. The complimentary afternoon reception and complete breakfast were excellent and enhanced an at-home atmosphere. The rooms were clean and roomy. We would stay here again."
"I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip."
"Very clean, very modern Shower curtain should have been changed, it was vile, but within 10 minutes, it was changed and the staff were apologetic. Our room had a view of the freeway which we liked. The man checking me in was LOUD! like everyone in the lobby knew what room I was in, my name and my address because he was just loud, but I only spoke to him the one time so that was good. Complimentary drink coupons at check-in for happy hour at the bar were a nice touch. Very comfy bed an super squishy pillows. Very happy with the visit."
"It was a wonderful experience.the room is nice, clean and spacious. The location is accessible to shoppers and they have a hotel service to the airport."
"great stay....pool hours are lousy!!!"
"This hotel is very nice. Comfortable bed, lots of room, great Breakfast. The only cheesy thing was their evening snack at happy hour. It was potato chips and cheese with a variety of dry snacks. They may as well have put out pretzels and nuts and called it a day. I expected more."
"I loved it but i think the parking is to high."
"Would recommend overall. We were there in January and the weather was very cold. We expected outside to be cold. The hotel's entrance doors were open a lot, tho, and that made the restaurant and seating ,common areas too cold to enjoy. Happy hour cold, breakfast cold Poor concierge employees very cold. Other times of the year would be better...OR rotational doors, Rooms was great and comfort in the room spot on"
"Beautiful hotel, very convenient to the metro in Crystal City. Wonderful complimentary breakfast. Enjoyed manager's reception nightly. Will stay here again - this was our second visit in 5 years to the same hotel. Spacious suites. Nice large flat panel televisions - 2 per suite. Workout room adequate. We had a dead battery in the hotel garage and the guest services attendant helped us find a car service employee who assisted us for no charge! Only suggestion - bathrooms need exhaust fans! I believe they are scheduled to be remodeled soon..."
"Good workout facility, eliptical machines and treadmills with TV's, abs machine and free weights. Nice room. Few blocks from the Metro and a shuttle runs to the Pentagon City station and Reagan Airport. Usual good Embassy breakfast, friendly competent staff."
"Brilliant hotel and very helpful staff"
"Room was great, staff was professional and helpful, and breakfast was delicious."
"All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us."
"the rooms were spacious and had fridge with microwave the beds were very comfortable amenties were great breakfast was awesone and yvonne at front desk was awesone"
"This is an older Embassy Suites that has been very well maintined and updated. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for 6 days and they did everything to make sure our stay was pleasurable. The restaurant is a great place to eat if you are too tired to venture out for dinner. The front desk has a great local restaurant list and the hotel van will drop you off and pick you up when you are finished eating. We loved the daily breakfast buffet and the evening manager's reception. The hotel is located about a block from the metro station. We enjoyed the daily walk to the station and found it very easy to get to all the sites we were they to see via the metro."
"This was one of the cheaper rates in the area. (This of course is a relative term in the DC area) I was surprised to find a great, spacious suite with great service. The price included a hot breakfast buffet. I'm looking forward to going back. Chuck"
"superb hotel. Can't go wrong with location, comfort or worth the money you spend for it. With breakfast buffet and afternoon reception you can't go wrong with meeting everyones wants. the rooms are comfortable and quiet. We were by the elevator and couldn't not here the elevator and traffic coming or going. Free transportation to local restuarants, metro and airport was just another bonus. All hotel personnel were top notch ..very friendly, helpful and efficient. Couldn't be happier with our trip and accommodations."
"I enjoyed the convenience of the location and having the Whole Foods store within walking distance was a plus."
"We enjoy the stay, we can visit all museums but for next time"
"My only one complaint is that you have not mentioned your phone number in the web site( when I took the print out after booking, there is no phone number on the sheet). I was not aware that your shuttle service will not pick from Crystal city metro station, so I waited for your vehicle for about 20mins, and then I got help from Rennainace hotel's shuttle.Thank you"
"An excellent value given the area. Very courteous and professional staff. We were astounded by the continental breakfast: complete w/chef! :) We enjoyed the since of security with the hotel's parking garage. Let's not forget the free drinks. ) A+++ would definitely stay again."
"This is a low-price hotel with very high quality. I was impressed with how fancy it was for such a great bargain. The breakfast is delicious. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Also, the staff is as nice as can be. I enjoyed my stay very much and decide to stay there everytime I visit Washington DC."
"nice room, located 4 blocks from Pentagon City Mall"
"Loved the breakfast!!"
"This hotel is convenient to Metro with large comfortable rooms and free breakfast."
"I stayed for 3 nights with my family. We enjoyed it. It is in a good location, actually not far from both crystal city and Pentogan city stations. However, we need to walk about 200 m to get to metro station of crystal city. This is a fine distance to walk. It is very quite and clean. Breakfast is excellent. The resturant also provide good grills. The stay is almost half or less than half price of Embassy suite in downtown, but it is only 15 min by metro from downtwon, and 1 stop by metro from the airport. It is an absolute great chioce to stay there."
"Excellent experience. The only issue I had was the small omelet that was served at breakfast. Other than that, it was a great stay !"
"Very nice suite, clean and neat as a pin, in a great location. Parking is in a gated garage (cost is extra)."
"Excellent"
"Spent 9 days at Embassy Suites while visiting family and sight-seeing. Short walk to Metro and access to all areas of DC made sight-seeing easy. Appreciated the full breakfast every morning and evening happy hour at end of day. Bed was comfortable room was clean and quiet small kitchenette was useful. Hotel shuttle to area restaurants also appreciated."
"It's was very comfortable and clean no problem"
"The hotel was very clean, staff was amazing and very helpful. I would definitely recommend this to a family or friend. Yes, if I'm in the area I would love to stay here again. Great facility"
"This hotel was great. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again."
"Very good service and accommodation."
"The breakfast buffet was phenomenal! The challenge was getting out of bed and get to breakfast on time!! The bed was very comfortable! Also, the breakfast staff were very hospitable. One of the chef (big guy) was wonderful at making sure we had the food we needed. He was very attentive to all guest needs. I will definitely stay again!"
"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny."
"Everything was clean and comfortable. The room was larger than any I have seen. The staff was very professional and friendly. I will stay here again when I come back to D.C."
"Excellent service"
"This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!"
"We stayed at this hotel the last week in December the weather was extremely cold, arrived 1 week after the snow storm but the hotel service was very warm. The shuttle service was excellent the would drop pick you up from any area inb their vicinity. Also need to mention that guest from another hotel was waiting in the cold at the mall and the shuttle driver offered to drop them to their hotel which was excellent service. The front desk staff are very helpful. Only downfall, the double room beds are little bigger than twin beds."
"We took our two grand children to see DC and stayed at the Embassy because of its convenience to the city. Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson."
"When all hotels in DC are over 250 during the week of the National Prayer Breakfast, it's so nice to have an affordable hotel near the Metro with complimentary breakfasts and DCA shuttles. Will definitely stay here again."
"Enjoyed cleanliness of room, quality of service and location near Metro and Fashion Center."
"My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!"
"Very nice, clean hotel. The staff was very friendly. However, the room was very warm and even though I adjusted the thermostat it was still too warm. The windows will open a couple of inches which helped. It was 17 degrees outside and 85 inside. So, it didn't take too long to cool the room temperature down. The breakfast was good. They actually have real eggs and you can get them cooked to order."
"I had a great stay. Staff was very friendly and welcoming."
"Clean, comfortable, good breakfast but parking and internet fee are extra which you have to consider. I decided not to use wifi and used from cell phone data plan. Other than that, everything was good."
"I had an amazing time. The hotel is close to all the tourist spots. The hotel has free shuttle service to and from the hotel and to the metro station. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to get out of bed. The free breakfast was amazing!"
"My stay was wonderful. The only thing I would adjust is the room temperature. I was not very cold."
"Friendly staff, very helpful, clean rooms. Metro across the street (Blue line 2 stops to Arlington, Yellow line 3 stops to monuments/museums). Nice if you want to stay outside the main sightseeing area. Would stay again."
"restaurant and room service food was quite good. was planning to go to some of the better restarants in town as we usualy try to do on vacation, but ended up eating in the hotel multiple times and not missing going out."
"Enjoyed every minute of our stay. Everything is convenient, the food, shopping, and sight seeing activities, I.e.,museums."
"We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC."
"What one would expect for an RC property. The restaurant was excellent and the room was spacious and comfortable. It is near many restaurants and the Metro station is right in front for an affordable commute into D.C. All things considered, a great pick for you stay in the D.C. area."
"The room is nice, luxury hotel, nice breakfast. Good location!"
"We enjoyed it very much because it is close to subways and to the airport,the attractions."
"The stay was a good little get away for me and my wife, and to take care of some business."
"Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area."
"first class experience! on the metro line! shopping next door!!! awesome sunday brunch !!!!"
"The service was the best by far friendly speedy made us feel at home"
"We had a great stay at the Ritz and would definitely stay there again. Everything was as you would expect."
"In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!"
"The service at the hotel was very good, friendly staff especially the valets. The only downside to our stay was the extremely hot temperature in the room, thermostat did nothing to improve the situation. We only stayed one night so we dealt with it."
"Arrived by subway, tired and worn. Met Frank at check-in. Took care of everything. Could not have been more helpful. Pointed out possibilities for dining after arrival, offered tips for maneuvering the subway. Frank stood out among all the VERY helpful and friendly staff. See you guys next year!"
"Customer service was exceptional"
"Fantastic - ease of travel convenience, location with respect to attending events (easy access to Metro), great bar at the hotel. I cannot think of a single negative and will stay there anytime I travel to D.C."
"We were there for only two nights, but we were extremely pleased. The meeting halls for our conference were great, our room was wonderfully comfortable, clean, and well-furnished, and most importantly the hospitality and courtesy shown to us as guests tops that of any other hotel we've ever stayed at. This hotel is right at a metro station for two lines that go straight into the downtown area, and is only 3 minutes from the airport. It's also connected to a wonderful mall. In all, the only word to describe the experience is, well, perfect!"
"Great facility and top-notch service at half the price of the comparable hotels across the Potomac. Easy access to DC via the Metro stop beneath the hotel."
"We loved this hotel! The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The food in the restaurant was delicious, and our grandchildren were given special attention and treats. Rooms were lovely and very comfortable."
"From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing"
"This hotel certainly keeps with the Ritz Carlton name. Great surroundings. great service, and great food all made for a relaxing stay."
"Newly renovated. Great room. and facilities. Attached to Pentagon Mall. Great shopping and restaurants. 8 minutes to Reagan National"
"The hotel staff are very friendly and professional. They went out of their way to ensure that my comfort was their priority. Everything I requested was brought to me in a timely manner. They also gave me my privacy when I needed it."
"We had an amazing experience. The hotel was very close to everything and every single employee had excellent customer service. Will definitely go back."
"Wonderful as always, the consistent level of quality is always reassuring and so pleasant"
"Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!"
"Great location for a Fourth of July weekend! Wonderful staff, comfortable room woulddefinitely stay here again!"
"Staff was very friendly. Lifeguard went out of his way for us as did all of the staff. My kids loved the little gift shop. Food was good with egg burritos, pancakes, sausage and lots more. Housekeeping did a great job with our room despite our kid's mess. Hotel has some older architecture that was very charming. Overall, great experience."
"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money."
"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price ."
"Wat een desolate toestand. Achterstallig onderhoud in het kwadraat in een desolate omgeving. Vieze lucht als je binnenkomt. Tijdens verblijf nog brand op een andere verdieping, geen noodplan geen enkele coordinatie. Risicovol om daar te slapen!! Het eten was zeer slecht!"
"Hotel was great, it had a free shuttle to the metro, great continental breakfast and was in a good location with a few restraints in the surrounding area as well as a grocery store"
"This is a one Star hotel . Dirty , smelly , in bad area . Definitely will not chose BW in future"
"i like and im going back ::)"
"Stayed at hotel for a football game nearby. Shower didn't drain. Shower curtain didn't stay on the shower curtain rod. Maid never remade the room. Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs."
"There was Hair in the pool there was hair in the bathroom there was hair in the hotel room there was hair everywhere. There was a night club in the hotel of some sort that made it impossible to park and made my 2 kids and I feel unsafe in the parking lot."
"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was a hit with the kids and it was great that they had an on duty life guard. Continental breakfast was more than your typical free breakfast with hot food."
"We were welcomed with cold drinks and a smiling friendly receptionist and manager as we looked tired after walking from the station. They asked why we had not rung for the shuttlebus (we tried but we had called the wrong number). We always used it since (the driver was NOT the smiling type). The continental breakfast was nearer a full breakfast as there were some cooked items."
"Staff was very nice and friendly, quick check in and check out, good variety offered for breakfast, good location. Only inconvenience on the weekend our family stayed there was a convention happening at the hotel on the Friday evening which made the lobby area were crowded and noisy."
"Guest services was amazing. The condition of the hotel left much to be desired."
"Clean and great customer service! Excellent place to stay."
"Overall very good stay..staff was very friendly. We at first were given a room without a fridge and microwave which we had booked. The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back."
"We checked in late (1:15 am) after a Monday night Redskin/Giants game - Hotel was full clerk at desk extremely busy but very accommodating to us. Our room was clean comfortable plus the refrigerator microwave I had requested was there. Breakfast was excellent staff friendly helpful. The clerk at checkout was relaxed friendly despite how extremely busy he was. We will stay here again next time we are in the area."
"The hotel is an economy hotel but it was one of the best my spouse and I stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends. So If you plan to use the pool you really have to plan for it. Overall my experience for this hotel was very nice."
"Will stay here any time I'm in Virginia Beach. I truly have no complaints at all. Free cookies at check-in, the most comfortable beds and pillows ever, and one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed."
"Very beautiful, quiet and decent priced hotel. A little far from the beach but we enjoyed the pool when we came from the beach."
"Rigtig godt hotel Super sdt personale Ca15min fra stranden"
"Great hotel for the price. Breakfast was delicious. Convenient location to main highways. Would definitely stay here again if I was in the area."
"As always, our room was very clean. The hotel itself was up to date and clean. Breakfast was excellent each of the four days. I left my laptop charger and housekeeping was right on top of it in getting it back to me."
"The manager Robert and Nature were very courteous and professional. Great Breakfast and a reception is held on Wednesday night for guests. We were extremely pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay again. Entire staff was great."
"The staff was very friendly, rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and breakfast was always good."
"I needed an affordable hotel close to Fort Story. The Hampton Inn was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom were of high quality, Neutrogena. anytime we needed anything (extra towels, paper plates for the pizza we had delivered, etc.) the staff was quick to help us. And having a hot breakfast with lots of options was great, too. There is an outdoor pool, but I did not use it. There is also a small workout room with a treadmill, an elliptical trainer, and a stationary bike, as well as weights. The neighborhood is very quiet, with a 7-11, Ruby Tuesday's, and a Rite Aid within walking distance. Freeway access was also very easy from there."
"Hotel was a good choice, about 10 mins from the actual beach but me and my family were satisfied. It would have been 100 perfect if there was an indoor pool, but it wasn't. Great hotel though!"
"Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the city. Had other obligations that put us on a short time schedule. Hope to visit again in the future. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were there for a 86 year old Aunt's birthday."
"The rooms and service was great. I can honestly say it has the best free breakfast at any I current have stayed at."
"Perfect for our needs. Convenient to freeways for quick access to anywhere in the Norfolk and Virginia Beach area."
"The room was a little on the to hot side and could not lower the temperature at all. The bed was not very comfortable. I believe it needed a new mattress. Other than that, price, location, decor, etc was great."
"My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway. The hotel is small but the rooms are big. There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker. Location is perfect, but at night it gets loud and rowdy, and there was some police activity just a block down (nothing bad, just drunken party goers). I would definitely stay here again."
"Great Inner Harbor location. The Staff is excellent and I will stay at this hotel anytime I am in Baltimorre"
"Amazing staff, very helpful, good breakfast. 1-2 blocks from all the tourist areas. We were there for a convention and its very easy to get to"
"I needed a room near convention center, very satisfied."
"Me and my family had a great time for a last minute trip"
"I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review."
"Wonderful accommodation and loved the area. We'll definitely be back!!"
"Nice quiet hotel in the middle of all attractions. ..clean and beautiful rooms."
"The Brookshire Suites was a perfect place to base ourselves while exploring Baltimore. It's walking distance to the water, to the Visionary Art Museum and to plenty of wonderful restaurants. For those who are looking for an experience instead of just a box room, this is the place for you: an overall well-designed feel with great art and friendly staff! We already booked this for our trip back in the fall."
"Wonderful. Spacious room. Friendly staff"
"We stayed at the hotel for the Army-Navy weekend. It was a WONDERFUL stay. The rooms were great- large- kitchen area with huge living room and a very comfortable bed. It was just one block from the Inner Harbor. The staff was outstanding!!! They were very helpful in answering any questions and gave very helpful suggestions for restaurants. We would definitely stay there any time we go back to Baltimore and the Inner Harbor."
"I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star."
"The room was very clean. Nice desk and chair. Friendly and efficient staff."
"Very convient location, but a little difficult to get to off the interstate.. You need to make a right at the light and make a U turn. The room was nice size, had a fridge and micro. No oder untill we turned on the AC unit.. nothing a little frebreeze in the filter didnt fix. The walls were a little thin, but didnt matter much, as the puppy heard everything and anything from a mile away.. hahahaha.....The front desk folks were just great. Some of the friendliest I have run across in hotels. Breakfest was good, Waffels, cereal, juice, coffee.. ect. Will def stay there again because of the pet friendly/no fee."
"We were glad to find a great place for a great price. We even got out for a walk after our flight and found the area to be safe and easy to walk around. The people were nice and the breakfast decent. We'd definitely recommend it."
"Hotel graciously granted my request for a different room, as I was assigned a 3rd floor room between several occupied by very boisterous girls basketball team. Teachers/coaches let them run wild until well after midnight. Unfortunately the team continued to run up and down corridors on all 3 floors."
"Our experience was near perfect - clean room and facility friendly helpful staff, Dog friendly with NO FEE, upgrade breakfast menu, just off I-295 so minutes from all major vacation or business locations all for half what you would pay for same elsewhere"
"That was the best most comfortable hotel stay I've ever had. Good breakfast and very friendly staff. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to VA Beach."
"We stayed at the LaQuinta only one night, but will return at every opportunity. They're pet friendly which is wonderful. Now my baby can be our traveling companion. The room was great, clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and we were very pleased with our stay."
"I will be returning the service was excellent"
"Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve."
"The hotel rooms are very nice, and clean. It would be nice if the rooms had a refrigerator or microwave. Overall I enjoyed my stay and will be staying again in the future."
"We stayed here for 4 days, the staff were very friendly, breakfast was good, rooms were clean, as was the swimming pool. i would recommend this hoel to my friends an family."
"Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!"
"I thought the overall experience at the hotel was very good. The only thing I did not like was that the cleaning of the room was late in the day after 2pm."
"We were tired from a very long drive from Boston and were very happy with everything that we saw. The staff were very professional and very nice. The bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place. The Breakfast was very varied and great. Everything was fresh."
"I was nicely greated as I entered the lobbie. while checking in they had my packet ready which included may of area, coupons and suggestions of activities. Very friendly staff throughout my stay."
"Wonderful! Especial nice for persons traveling with pets!"
"Truly a nice hotel. People very friendly and helpful."
"Great"
"Hotel tr√®s bien situ√© pour se rendre √† new-york (port authority bus terminal √† 10 min autobus en face de l'hotel #320, 3.15$) Chambre tr√®s pratique avec micro-onde et frigo emplacement calme apr√®s une journ√©e pass√© dans la jungle de NYC. Chambre de qualit√© sup√©rieur."
"Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night."
"We are midway through our week at the Inn. We are enjoying our stay. We chose gulf front and have not been disappointed. Attractive room, excellent staff, and having bikes, chairs, boards and kayaks available is fun. As far as no see ums biting bugs common to South Florida, the lotion provided by the Inn seems to be working. The... More"
"Very nice stay, advantage of free bicycle and paddle board as well as chairs umbrella on the beach"
"It rocked. Went for a two day concert, so many fellow showmates stayed at the hotel. The pool area was transformed into a pre-game party with food and tunes. The hotel and staff were outstanding. The only drawback was that it would have been nice if the hotel shuttle operated on the weekend."
"The living room area was cramped and the cable wasn't that great but other than that, for the price the stay was good."
"The hotel was nice for a weekend getaway. Nice staff and clean room. The best part was the full kitchen, which had everything you would need to cook and eat, all you need is to supply the food."
"Rooms are very comfortable and clean. The Staff was very friendly and nice."
"When we booked the hotel we knew that they were undergoing renovations so we expected some inconvenience. The checkin area was in a different location, all you needed to do was follow the signs. Checkin was fast. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a king in each room. The room was recently renovated and was absolutley beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 adults. We will be reserving a room again next September. There is shopping, food an liquor store right around the corner. The only downside was that our room was directly under the temporay breakfast cafe. If possible, that should be the last room to be checked into."
"The room was great - bright, clean, airy, spacious. Bed and pillows were comfortable. I thought the common areas were fine as well. Breakfast was great. My only complaint is that the halls and lobby are a little shabby looking. Carpet's worn front desk was sloppy. However, if I ever need to stay in Columbia again, this will be my spot."
"My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent."
"Perfect"
"This was a last minute booking. You walk into clean hotel that doesn't smell like smoke. Staff was great and checked us in along with explaining the times for breakfast buffet, wifi access and other necessities. Room was big and clean. Soft bed, clean bedding, modern decor, kitchen with all necessities and clean bathroom. If I return definitely coming back here."
"hier stimmte alles"
"Clean spacious room, courteous staff, great breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that in addition to the warm breakfast, the Staybridge offered a light dinner Tues. through Thurs. We will definitely stay there again when visiting relatives in Columbia."
"I had a wonderful experience with this hotel. It's minutes away from down town Baltimore and minutes away from other popular attractions. I can't wait to return! definitely a keeper!! I hit the jackpot!!"
"Everything I needed was provided in a nice comfortable room."
"The air blowing from the furnace made the bedroom either too cool or too warm. Other than that I couldn't have been more pleased with every aspect of our stay at Sonesta. Thank you!"
"The suites are comfortable and clean, and the staff is wonderful. I know exactly where I'll be staying anytime I'm around Baltimore."
"First time here and it will definitely not be my last. This hotel is beautiful. Had the 2 bedroom suite and it was awesome. Love Everything about it. You cannot go wrong with this hotel."
"Employees were great and rooms were really nice. Safe area."
"Clean room, very helpful staff. Had directions pre-printed to area malls, etc. Most hotels serve complimentary breakfast but these guys served dinner also. Real nice place."
"Everything we ate was fresh and tasty! We had the best stuffed blueberry french toast and make sure you try the pecan chicken. Melts in your mouth!"
"We decided to go on a little getaway weekend to Chimney Rock to unwind from a very stressful week. Of course we chose the Esmeralda for our lodging which seemed like the perfect place for a relaxing night away. We definitely wanted to try the Esmeralda Restaurant after checking the menu out were drawn to many of their delicious... More"
"Everything met or exceeded our expectations on this leg of our trip. The property was clean, organized, and very easy to navigate. The upstairs game room would appear to have everything you could want if you desired to stay in and relax. As far as the breakfast is concerned, we very much enjoyed it. We didn't not expect the service... More"
"We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Esmeralda Inn. Everyone is so friendly and helpful...they even made a special substitute breakfast for me to accommodate my gluten free restrictions. We stayed in room 2, with a beautiful view of Chimney Rock. We could hear the river sounds as we drifted off to sleep. I only wish we could have... More"
"We traveled there over our Spring Break to get away and relax. This was our second visit and it was even better than before. The hospitality was above and beyond and the restaurant was over the top. The chef had prepared some amazing dishes that were out of this world and not so expensive that it hurt the wallet. We... More"
"As a result of an unfortunate booking glitch at another facility, we found The Esmeralda and fortunately they had a vacancy.

"I admit that I have never stayed at a Best Western property ever before now. I loved this hotel!!!! This hotel was fabulous! The staff was friendly and courteous.

"We needed a place to stay as our bathroom was being renovated. Extremely quick check in ( called earlier to make reservation).

"Great hotel!! Easy access to rte. 93, located in a quiet commercial area, spacious rooms, super clean, welcoming staff, Starbucks in the lobby - worth every penny!! Will stay here agin next time we're in the area!!"
"Quiet location in an office park. 15 minutes to downtown Boston. Great location for touring the city."
"Far from Boston if you do not have a car Front desk night time super. I will like to give 10 Starst Pero so far for me This time I didn't have a car. I paid. Cab a lot. Not shuttle not even to Main st. S No shuttle I did asked on the time Of my check in. If you don't have a car is far from Boston. But I recommend this hotel if you have a car , is nice and clean , love it."
"My wife and I live about 15 minutes from Boston but stay at a hotel there 2 or 3 times a year without our son in order to keep our marriage fresh. When we tried to find a hotel in mid-October 2015 the cheapest hotel in Boston was 369. I love my wife but not that much -) So long... More"
"Booked a room at the last minute - sight unseen. How refreshing to see a hotel in a nice setting, but close to Route 93 and Boston. The front desk personnel, condition of the room and, can you belive it - a hotel breakfast was over the top. This is my first choice for hotels north of Boston."
"The staff went above and beyond to make our stay the best it could be!"
"The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!"
"My first time staying at this hotel, stayed here for a week. The staff was fantastic and go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. My room was very clean and comfortable.

We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay and hope that you will return soon!"
"When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again."
"It is alittle hard to find Get detailed directions Fast airport pickup Very nice employees"
"We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it."
"The hotel was clean, and the staff friendly."
"It was NICE, The room was clean and close to where I had to conduct business the next day."
"My family of six wanted a hotel that would be comfortable but did not offer many amenities that would up the price because we did not plan to be in the hotel except to sleep. I found this hotel very comfortable and clean and would recommend it for a family on a weekend stay (as it is located in a technology park and might be busier during the week). It was relatively inexpensive and close to both Baltimore and DC."
"Great experience all in all! Perfect for what I needed. Would stay again if staying in Columbia, MD area!!!!!!"
"This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada."
"Everything was Excellent!!! Quality Service! Will be coming Back!!!!"
"I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)"
"Great stay but if you don't have a car, your cab around would be 15 to the mall"
"I was driving from NY to NC and decided that I needed to rest. It was after 9pm . I pulled over to a rest stop and looked up Expedia for hotels near by. I got a hand full and picked one within my budget . What a relief to have that choice. my stay was pleasant , room was Clean, great staff. And free breakfast. Within 15minutes of booking , Ramada had my reservations. :)."
"Overall great experience! The staff was excellent! I have never encountered such a friendly staff before my stay here! My only complaint would be the need for some updating in the showers....BUT other than that I absolutely would recommend to everyone!"
"No problem - complimentary breakfast was ready and waiting for us - found everything satisfactory"
"My son and I spent the night here and found it to be very clean and the staff to be very courteous."
"Park and Fly service available"
"The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that."
"Friends and I went to see a show at Ramshead Live at the casino. The Ramada was perfect for our purposes and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful when we were looking to arrange for a cab."
"Staff at Front Desk VERY helpful and friendly and helpful with the area information,"
"not good"
"Was not pleased that it rained my stay because I did not have a chance to visit the pool. The food at the grill was really good! Great turkey club and burger!! Awesome drinks......needed more alcohol but good. Shuttle from airport little slow but staff wanted to make you comfortable."
"I got a great rate at this hotel. If I was staying in the area again, I would spend the night at this hotel. I'm sure i'll be back! This hotel gives great service and a great room."
"I have stayed at many Ramada's over the years. This location was very run down. Carpet was soiled and dated. Had to call front desk for a TV remote and then get it ourselves. Continental breakfast was sadly lacking. Even the batter for the Waffles seemed watered down."
"I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!"
"The room was very nice. Even had a microwave as well as fridge. Big screen tv. The only negative in my room was the toilet seat. I had to have someone come clean it and they were right on it."
"Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply."
"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else."
"All new renovated hotel!! Great prices. Excellent staff!! A little tough to get to on the back roads but well worth it!"
"Pigsty. Room wasn't cleaned they claimed to only have smoking rooms available. Rowdy drunks till 3am."
"We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals."
"I really hope someone in the hotel groups management reads this. I will give a little background on the situation. The first part is completely out of the hotels control and I don't blame them for any of it, but their part in what happened to me and my mother last night is frankly disgusting. My dad passed away quite... More"

The location of the hotel will take you to any point in the DC Metropolitan The greatest thing in this hotel is the staff lead by Ms. Julia Hanson-Takyi, General Manager. Julia is very helpful person. She is outstanding in serving the customers. She always doing her best to make the stay comfortable and... More"
"I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!"
"Cleanliness of the hotel was spot on. The staff at check in was very helpful. The room was very large and could accommodate my family with comfort and ease. A great stay and a great value."
"Hotel was great! breakfast was good and the staff we're very nice"
"The staff was amazing and helpful. Very clean and quiet. Room was beautiful. Will highly recommend to anyone."
"It was a great stay the only problem is that Hotels.com booked and charged me for two rooms. I only reserved one room. I am still waiting for Hotels.com to acknowledge their mistake and refund my account."
"IT WAS OUR MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARY 52ND WHEN THE MANGER HEARD THAT THEY GAVE US A FREE ROOM UPGRADE."
"Excellent service, great staff , I like the complimentary breakfast"
"Was a good time. Housekeeping missed us one day but we're quick to come when we called about it.would stay again"
"The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!"
"when we checked in the desk clerks were very very nice and helpful the rooms were very clean and i had requested a room no higher than 3rd floor and they very nicely accomodated my request the pool was wonderful and the buffet breakfast was awesome the food was hot and delicious i will definitely stay at this motel again on my future visits to va beach"
"The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and a decent size for VA Beach. It was off-season, but everything was still fine. I think they are renovating the other side of the building, but our side was business as usual. The heated pool was a bonus!"
"Great room. Very clean and comfortable! Great ocean view!"
"I enjoyed our stay at Best Weatern Plus oceanfront!"
"Really nice room...comfortable king bed, great ocean view from balcony on 5th floor. Bathroom was little tight to go in shut door. Love the afternoonsunshine coming in through glassed-in hallway leading to rooms. Access to boardwalk beach was quick easy. The breakfast was way more than continental delish. Price was decent since it was off-season, that's when we choose to stay overnight most anywhere. We would def stay there again!"
"Nice"
"Very convenient, good breakfast, plenty of parking. Would definitely stay there again."
"Over night stay on business room was in good shape a lot of newness and clean Breakfast was ok, could use a waffle machine, some food in buffet could be fresher."
"A coworker I went to see the Jimmy Buffett concert. Just stayed the night but had a gorgeous oceanfront room. Hotel was pretty full but quiet. Free HOT continental breakfast was good, lots of choices. Would definitely stay again, especially when the weather is warmer not so windy!!"
"loved the customer service. Kudos to Dawn for making our anniversary extra special in the oceanfront room. Great placed within easy walking distance of Catch 31 and Sushi. Will definitely stay here again!!"
"The hotel was great! The check in/out was quick and simple. The employees at every level were very courteous. The restaurant in the hotel had great food. Rooms were very clean and had a great view of the ocean. The amenities were great. The hotel was located near great shopping and seafood restaurants. I will stay here again for all of my future vacations to Virginia Beach."
"Perfect location. Very nice rooms. Great included breakfast. Very helpful, competent, and friendly staff. Will visit again."
"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel."
"Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location."
"It was awesome they were friendly and the cleaning was above and beyond. Friendly personel exelent location. Exeptional overall value. I'll be back!!!!"
"Loved it"
"Very easy to find. Close to beach and activities. Great breakfast. Would return again. Beach nice and clean."
"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!"
"Quiet and peaceful surrounding neighborhood during off season, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and balcony with view of the beach."
"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach."
"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly."
"The room was not tidy, the customer service was horrible!!!! We could not stay the second night. Had to leave because the hotel service and cleanliness, and no hot water!!!!!!!!!!!"
"There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring."
"We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough."
"me and my girlfriend was just looking for a random hotel to stay in since she live in north carolina i stay in virginia came across this for a gud price booked it enjoyed our little weekend together loved the kitchen and the water n the shower wasnt cold had no problem that wasnt fixable it was a nice comfortable stay"
"From booking reservations out of state to check in to breakfast, the reception we experienced by the staff was heart warming and genuine. Hampton Inn went beyond any expectations we had during our stay."
"Perfect location to get to merriweather, tons of food options across the street. Staff was helpful."
"We stay at this hotel every time we come to Columbia. It has a great location, great service and overall just a nice place to stay."
"Great Room, Great Staff!! Would recommend to anyone staying in that area."
"all new amenities and great free breakfast, quiet location, very clean, very nice and friendly staff, definitely will stay there again!"
"Nous avons eu un superbe sejour ! La decoration, la proprete, le dejeuner la piscine, tout y etait pour faire plaisir a une jeune famille en transit."
"Great. The only problem was the WiFi connection."
"Great location and a very friendly, helpful staff. Immaculate room and hotel with all the amenities one could ask for. The morning breakfast changed its entree every morning and the coffee was delicious and available all day. The housekeeping staff is very thorough and the room was beautiful. I would highly recommend this Hampton Inn to anyone looking for location and an extremely clean and well appointed place to stay at a very affordable price. This will be our go to hotel whenever we visit family in Maryland."
"I have always loves this hotel. Besides being close to the highway for easy assess to all the areas attractions. It is tucked away for peace of mind."
"I stayed here with my family and the facility is outdated, the entrance smelled horrible. They didn't have an HDMI port for the tv, no extra comforters, the beds were a little uncomfortable"
"Please look at Google reviews for TRUE REVIEW!"
"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel was extremely clean and well laid out. Room was very spacious. Could use a little more lighting in the room. In a nice area and very close to University of Maryland, College Park."
"Expedia and I the Purchase of Service Not Rendered and Paid For..hummm What do you Think I bought INSURANCE from EXPEDIA what a JOKE - YOU GUYS ARE FUNNY NOT SO MUCH"
"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast is outstanding! This is where our family always stays whenever we are in the Washington, D. C. area."
"The facility is nice and has a great lobby and bar for happy hour events. Enjoyed my stay which was nice and quiet. The renovated rooms were very comfortable."
"Only complaint was the room got very hot during the night because the thermostat was not working properly. Have stayed at this location before and did not have any problem with heating or cooling."
"very lousy front desk"
"Es un excelente Hotel. Las habitaciones son muy bonitas y el desayuno es muy bueno. Desde la estacion del metro en New Carrollton (a menos de 4 minutos del hotel en carro) nos tardamos menos de 25 minutos en llegar a la estacion del metro Smithsonian. Recomendado 100!!!!n"
"I was very uncomfortable after seeing ants in my room and the tub acrylic was chipping away... This stay was not sanitary!!! We moved to another room but my comfort level was gone!!! I just felt dirty!!! I expected a better stay for the price I paid."
"Location is great for all budget shoppers and easy access to interstates highway. Breakfast was awesome!!"
"L'hotel e a 20 minuti da Washington ma si raggiunge facilmente grazie ad una superstrada e il prezzo e molto conveniente rispetto alle grandi catene presenti in citta."
"I needed a clean comfortable room at the last minute due to my being called back to work at the last minute, and The Metro Points fit the bill. Special Thanks to Lavere (front desk) for his professionalism kindness."
"The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning."
"Fanatic"
"Check in was speedy. Everything was clean. Room was comfy. The breakfast was a little average but overall everything was fine."
"There for a week and every day every staff member was very helpfull. They have a shuttle to the metro station and the drivers were very nice. They even gave us their cell to call them so we won't have to wait. The cleaning crew was always helful and friendy. The room was super and the beds were really good. Breakfast was good and you have the convenience of a 7eleven across the street to pack some water and snacks for the day. For shure we'll be back to this great hotel. THANK YOU!"
"We were a famaily of 4. Great hotel. The lobby and the room were top class. Almost like a luxury hotel. Breakfast was included in the price. Excellent breakfast. Very happy to choose this one. Will come back next time."
"Excelente hotel buena atencion y la ubicacion buena , lo unico que falta para que sea completo el hotel es que tenga una nevera ejecutiva. Del resto excelente ."
"The hotel was clean and the imenities met my needs."
"This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there."
"The staff was very professional and helpful. The room's are very modern and clean. I was very please with the complimentary continental breakfast of eggs, fruit orange juice french toast and waffles and coffee. I would highly recommend this establishment."
"The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad"
"It was wondering, I had a great time, food was great"
"Everybody from the front desk to those that cleaned the room did a fantastic job of making our stay very enjoyable. Thanks to all of them."
"Overall very excellent. No negative all positive. I think for the price you can't go wrong. Also it was a quiet atmosphere."
"Me parecio un excelente hotel, a pesar de estar lejos de Washington es muy facil llegar alli, el shuttle te lleva a la estacion del tren y en 20 minutos estas en el centro de Washington, el personal es muy amable y aunque no todos hablan ingles hacen lo posible por entender y hacerse entender. El senor del shuttle habla espanol y es muy amable. El desayuno es agradable y variado. En general es un hotel recomendado para pasar unos dias, descansar y visitar la ciudad."
"Metro Points Hotel provides wonderful service for a very reasonable price. They even offer a convenient shuttle service to and from the nearest metro station at no extra charge. Every staff member was helpful and pleasant."
"Booked a room last min under promotion. Came with free breakfast. Nice hotel."
"The hotel was very good,I didn't have any problems. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
"Had a wonderful time here, and I will be coming back! The rooms are very nice, it's located perfectly close to everything, and the staff accommodates your needs to the best of their ability!"
"Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard."
"This is the best in that price I've ever had. We stayed in room 807 ,The room was big,clean,and comfortable, everything is good for us."
"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again."
"Worked out perfect for our sightseeing in DC."
"Loved this hotel. The staff was wonderful. There was a complimentary shuttle to take you to the subway. We were there to visit Washington which was only a 35 minute ride so we did not have to drive our car. The complimentary breakfast was great with lots of choice."
"It was very nice i enjoyed myself"
"Adorei! Recomendo a todos! Apesar de nao ficar em Washington fica muito perto o que facilitou muito para conhecermos a capital com um custo de hotel do interior."
"My experience was wonderful, will look forward to book it again in the future. The room was just what I was expecting for and the staffs were very friendly and attentively."
"Everyone was great. Very close to the Metro."
"I was concerned about the location, because of the reviews, but it is a nice area. Far, of course, from the points of interest, but if you want to stay right next to rhe White House you have to pay the price. Very eficient staff, very clean room. I just hated the restaurant. The waitress was very slow, the food was not so bad, but when it finally got to our table it was already cold. I would rather go to McDonald's."
"Needed a good value hotel. This turned out to be perfect. Heavily booked, but it did not affect customer service from the employees I had contact with."
"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area."
"comfortable, clean and affordable"
"Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel."
"The staff were extremely helpful. They offered directions and even a weather report for us during our stay. The room was very comfortable and well stocked with towels. Breakfast was simple but very satisfying. It is only open for about 2 hours. It has been updated and I really liked the improvements. You can tell that the owners and staffers care about their property and it shines through. I would absolutely stay here again. Very reasonable and a perfect location. Less then a minute from I-95."
"This hotel is outside of DC, but its shuttle goes directly to the metro, which goes directly to sites in DC. Everyone on the staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was served starting at 6:30am, which allowed us to depart early each day. We would stay here again."
"It was very nice. The staff was professional and friendly. The free breakfast was a nice treat."
"This may be the best motel I have ever stayed in. My wife still wants to go back so we can sleep in the bed again. Very nice!"
"Had a 7:30am tour of the White House and wanted to be near public transportation (New Carrolton Station). Metro Points fit the bill and was recently renovated. A good price from Expedia sealed the deal for us. Upon arrival we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The two adjoining rooms were clean and well appointed. Local amenities offered a wide choice of restaurants, and a local IHOP was open 24x7 to support our early morning breakfast and travel needs. MetroPoint even provided a 15 discount. We would definitely stay again."
"Clean room and public areas, updated colors and design. Good full American breakfast (scrambled eggs were very fluffy, not soggy and runny). A 5 glass of wine at the lobby bar was extremely reasonable. Hotel had several motorcoach groups there, but the front desk seemed to process their check-in/check-out very efficiently. All staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel shuttle runs to the metro stop, so you can easily get into D.C. without driving. I'd stay here again."
"This site was very nice. It's close to the interstate and close to DC. You won't be disappointed."
"Very good experience. But the staff manner need improve."
"O hotel e meio longe do centro de Washington, mas valeu pelo conforto e pelo preco. O hotel oferece um transporte para ida e volta para o metro para compensar a distancia: Gostei"
"Muy buen hotel"
"My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons."
"this is well big and nice place to stay for holiday trip"
"My experience in this hotel has been one of a kind. Everything seems to be on point. I would recommend this place to others. Also, great price! Full breakfast included. Nice!"
"My wife and I were spoilt silly by sheer hospitality. We had a wonderful stay, my only issue was that we could not be given a hard bed (mattress) so I experienced back pain throughout our stay."
"Friendly desk personnel. Friendly staff. Free shuttle service from the hotel to the metro station. Breakfast arrangements were comfortable. My room had an excellent view. I highly recommend this hotel."
"Got off to a rocky start, but after I was able to make the staff aware of my concerns my stay was FANTASTIC. I will Definitely make this my location of choice when I am in the DC area. I would also like to state there is no one staff member that I can commend over anther. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and it takes a lot to impress me I am impressed!"
"The staff were friendly and helpful. the complimentary cooked breakfast was excellent the gym was well equipped and clean"
"Pretty good place they are under remodel but they let you know that. You'll feel safe because the cops are always there not because of problems they just hangout there."
"Just needed an overnight stay and it was right off the belt way. Very nice place for the price to be honest. Very close to metro and off the main road so you don't see much traffic either."
"don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for."
"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!"
"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again."
"My daughter is a student at Virginia Tech, we had traveled down to attend farm day. The hotel is close, clean, good breakfast (except the eggs, they taste weird). Gotta be aware even tho this is not a tourist area, there is a big difference between season and off-season rates, I did the same exact trip a month (june) ago and it was 40 less a night"
"Friendly staff, nice clean room, good hot breakfast"
"Even if it was just for a night passing through, everyone was amazing. The room was clean, we were not bothered at all, the staff was very helpful when needed, everything was quiet when it shouldve been. Amazing. Will definitely come back."
"Staff was very nice and helpful, room was clean..............."
"They don't cancel a reservation even when requested a week ahead of time. Be careful when you book this inn. I had to throw my money since they didn't give me a refund. TOO BAD!!!"
"It was perfect for my travel needs for work. Hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. If you stay here you have to eat at the Greene Turtle, it's a 1/4 of a mile away with great food."
"Very restful and quite. Also had a nice pool to relax in."
"easy to find ,,,,, great stay"
"Great Customer Service. Nice Place and rooms were cleaned and uptodate"
"Good location, easy access to restaurants and hospitals."
"This hotel is convenient to the metro and only a four stops from downtown Washington. It has limited shuttle service to the metro as well. My wife and I will use it again as a good alternative to the high-priced hotels downtown when feasible."
"This hotel is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. It is convenient, affordable, and the rooms are spacious."
"This hotel is a terrific value. The staff,is always great, it's clean, and it's close to things. It's appliances are a little older, but they work perfectly! I always stay here when I'm in town."
"this beautiful hotel was as quiet, comfortable, charming and accommodating as it was beautiful. the room was all of these things and felt like a home away from home."
"This is a beautiful hotel room. The high ceilings and dated architecture were appreciated. The suite I stayed in had all of the amenities that I would have needed (had I actually cooked there). Very nice staff. I forgot my toothpaste and within minutes housekeeping brought me a new tube. Other places I've had to go to the front desk, or they would take hours. The work out room was a little dated, but they did have a total body machine that was good to use."
"Hotel is under renovations and you would not know it the way the staff, front desk and sales treated you. The room was great, much space. I stayed with my son and daughtger in a studio suite and were very comfortable. the hotel is located ina excellent location with easy acess to all surrondings. I would stay they again,"
"The motel was 10 min fro the metro station. It was very convenient. A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen"
"Perto de uma estacao de metro. Transporte gratuito para o metro. Quarto enorme. Camas enormes. Cobertas confortaveis. Tudo limpissimo."
"All round wonderful experience. From the time we got there to the time we left the staff and service was outstanding. Ryan the Guest services person who checked us in set the tone for the rest of the stay. He was extremely courteous and helpful with all our requests, offered us advice on transportation and dining in the area which was great. We ate at the Quarter Deck restaurant he recommended all three days we were there for lunch it was so good. Cant say enough good things about the Virginian Suites!!! If your looking for a nice clean place close to everything at about half the price of the hotels downtown, you have to stay at the Virginian Suites. Cant wait to go back."
"Very nice. the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. They were so helpful. Sabine (sp) was especially helpful."
"Came to area to visit Washington D C, Mt. Vernon and monticello without having to drive everywhere. Although we drove to mt Vernon one day and Monticello on the way home it was nice not having to drive into DC to find a place to park."
"Location is awesome price well worth the money. The staff is very friendly and helpful."
"Since we had a 7:55 a.m. flight to the West Coast, leaving from in an unfamiliar area, we chose the Virginian based on its proximity to the airport. The check in was easy, the printed directions to get to Reagan Airport were concise and re-explained verbally."
"The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy."
"My stay was short...wished I could have stayed longer. Check in was fast. Staff very professional. Hotel was clean and inviting. Suite was spacious for a high rise Hotel. Expected cramped however, was pleasently surprised by it's size. Restaurant and convenience stores within walking distance. The Hotel is in a residential neighborhood, not much activity surrounding it. Although there is a fee for parking, It was the cheapest in the area."
"Good parking lot size at hotel - no problems finding a spot for me. Hotel had a Tues night guest reception which was well attended the night I went...had food and drinks there. Hotel is older, but very clean. Front desk and all of staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Room was like an apt in size/good kitchen set up. I extended my stay for 2 extra nights. I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well."
"We felt like home. We are planning to go back in the near future. The staff is very polite. Viginia Suites is within walking distance from mass transit and that make it easy to travel to the main atractions in Washington D.C. We highly recommend Virginia Suites to any one planning to visit Washington."
"I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner."
"This hotel more than met our expectations, very close to the metro station, 5-10 mins walk, but a free shuttle bus operates anyway so you don't have to walk. Very close to Washington and Arlington Cemetery. The neighbourhood felt safe and we had no fear of walking out even late at night, highly recommended."
"I first read the reviews of this hotel on this site and mostly all said great things about this hotel and i can see why. When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have. Great area, and you can walk to Iwo Jima memorial, or walk to Rosslyn area to eat. I will return with fam friends in spring time....."
"Short stay and close to metro. The hotel shuttle to the metro station was great."
"We had a very positive experience at this hotel. Our party (2 adults, 2 teenagers) had plenty of room to spread out. We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs."
"The Virginian Suites is a great hotel with an extremely friendly and helpful staff."
"Der har ikke vret noget at klage over. Virginian Suites har indeholdtog budt p de tjenesteydelser, vi selv har fordret. Derfor har vi vret srdeles godt tilfreds. Derfor faldt valget ogs p Virginian Suites, da vi p tilbagevejen p vores rejse skulle finde logi for de sidste 2 dage."
"I stayed here during my trip to DC on the Memorial Day weekend. I found this hotel very clean and comfortable. It is close to the Metro Station (5-10 min walk or 5 by cab) which is a big plus. Good neighbourhood. No Room service but lots of reasonable options to order from. Super nice room with kitchen. Didnt use much of the hotel services but found this place worth the money I spent. I didnt face any issues during my stay and would recommend this to my friends."
"S"
"I'm very satisfied with my 6 nights stay with the hotel. Very close to the metro. The room is huge, clean and comfortable. The kitchen with a microwave, fridge, range, cooking utensils and plates, is a plus. The staff is friendly.I highly recommend this hotel."
"I chose this hotel because it already had a very good rating and it is fairly close to DC. The staff are really helpful and there is a shuttle bus to and from the metro system. The room was clean, in very nice condition and everything worked well."
"Brought my sister and brother in law from south Africa here and its location and comfort just wowed them. The longer you stay the more convenient that kitchen becomes."
"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM"
"The rooms are very nice. Large flatscreen TV, kitchen...more like a small apartment than a hotel room. Only bad thing was that it's not super close to restaurants or bars. Other than that though, it's a great deal for the price, and very close to the metro."
"Excellent travel and it was a relax place to visit"
"people with solid schedules moving toward success don't have time for this much detail to you"
"We had an extremely pleasant stay at the Virginian Suites Hotel. Like staying in an apartment it was so spacious. The hotel is convenient to everything and within walking distance to the metro which I did because the traffic was so bad most mornings I could beat the hotel transport. Everything was clean and they even have a breakfast. We would stay here again. Also very quiet for sleeping."
"A single parent traveling with two children. I felt very safe. This hotel centrally located to everything. The room was very well kept. This hotel does not rate on the same scale as a five star hotel, but it does rate 5 stars for the kitchen facility, pool area and friendliness of staff. Book with confidence."
"I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very close to downtown DC. Clean hotel, friendly staff, good rate. Large rooms. Great experience."
"Clean. Friendly staff. Very large rooms. Highly recommend."
"My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington."
"Good value compared to the hotels downtown DC. Good room, and good service."
"This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again."
"Coffee Pot Leaks and does not make HOT coffee. Had to request Toilet Paper TWICE. NOT the Worst we've stayed but FAR FROM THE BEST for that price."
"sehr gut gelegenes Hotel."
"We enjoyed our stay at this suite hotel. The entire staff was very helpful and accommodating. The AC unit in our room needed repair, and within 5 minutes, a maintenance staff member promptly arrived and had it fixed within 30 minutes! The front desk staff were extremely helpful with directions to transportation, local grocery stores within walking distance, even printing our boarding passes for our flight home! Thank you all!"
"This was a convenient place to stay and then ride the Metro (only 1 mile walk) into DC to see the sights. The quality and value of the hotel were outstanding. I loved having a suite, it made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I called and requested extra towels and coffee and they brought them within 5 minutes."
"What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything."
"Close to Arlington Cemetery (15-20 minute walk)and Metro (10 min walk). Hotel is an older building but suitable for it's 2.5 star rating. Hi-speed internet in room was nice."
"Spent 3 nights. Very large rooms and full kitchen that is separate from the bedroom which is important, since you do not hear the refrigerator. On Wednesday, Oct. 21 they had all you can eat complimentary pizza."
"The rooms are HUGE. Parking is the cheapest I've seen at any hotel in Arlington. It isn't right in the city, but it is definitely worth the cab (or hotel shuttle ride) into downtown. Always extremely clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really can't say enough. This was my sixth time staying at the Virginian Suites and I keep coming back. Love it!"
"This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel."
"Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat. Hotel staff was overheard telling others to Shut your mouth. Reception was not manned had to wait 15 minutes for check-in and longer for check-out before staff arrived.."
"Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room. The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all."
"This was my second visit to the Island and second stay at Days Inn. The staff is friendly and helpful which is why I will definitely return!!"
"Overall, the quality of my 3 day stay was good. The room and bathroom were clean, the bed was comfortable, the noise level was low, and the staff were polite and helpful. The workout room is adequate. The breakfast was descent and the hotel is conveniently located. Would stay there again!"
"The Residence Inn in Naples was a great place to stay in Naples. They upgraded us to a two bedroom suite after the first night which was very nice (I'm a Platinum member). Thanks Lauren! Close to downtown, beaches and plenty of restaurants. The pool area is very nice and all of the staff was great. Highly recommended for families."
"Last minute stay and we could not have been more pleased! We stayed in a 2 bedroom with another couple and it was just perfect. The morning breakfast was out of this world! We did not get to enjoy the pool and the other amenities but many people seem to be having fun. We would definitely stay here again. Also,... More"
"The beds and pillows were soft and comfy!!! Staff was very friendly! The free continental breakfast was great with lots of choices. They even offered complimentary water with oranges all day to guests. The pool and basketball court are great for kids! We would stay here again for sure!"
"I have booked this hotel for employees on several trips for an installation project in town. I have gotten several great reports from each trip by employees. The staff and manager are always kind, courteous, and on top of things. Rooms are always clean and inviting. The hotel is centrally located for restaurants, beach, businesses, and shopping."
"My wife, teenage son and I stayed in a 2 bedroom suite at the hotel between Sunday 10/07/16 and Thursday 14/07/16. On arrival the receptionist was very friendly and professional. We requested a high floor suite and we were allocated room 318 and were assured that we would like the suite. After completing the registration the reception asked if we... More"

"Stayed here July 22-25, 2016. The front desk people were true gems, very helpful and friendly. The rooms were clean and wifi was free. All guest rooms have a refrigerator and a microwave. The breakfast buffet was great, lots of variety and both hot and cold foods. Free chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies in the lobby each night."
"This is my second visit at this Hampton Hotel. I love this hotel. The front desk staff are so very friendly, kind and helpful. The manager, Landon and Seph are super friendly and helpful. I always look forward to sinking into their wonderful comfy beds. The breakfast is incredible!! Fabulous service!!"
"Extremely disability friendly! Staff was awesome (especially Seph who kept us laughing!). This hotel is centrally located with restaurants near and far depending on your taste. The front desk will give you a list with a multitude of different types of restaurants. The hotel itself was clean, great water pressure and actually had a healthy fruit option for breakfast. Staff... More"

"We picked this hotel because it was halfway between Tampa and Miami. The front desk staff is so nice and helpful. They answered every question and even came and cleaned our room when housekeeping missed us. The cookies after 6 p.m. in the lobby are essential. Great stay"
"From check in to check out this was a great experience. The staff was amazing, friendly and informative. Room was immaculate and comfortable. Nice size and great bed.

"A few miles west of I-75. Near restaurants and mall. Staff was friendly and helpful. Room was clean. Hotel appeared to be fairly new. We had a king bedded room with sofa bed. For this area a car is needed."
"The staff makes you feel welcome from the moment you arrive. They are all friendly, efficient and caring. Complimentary breakfast stays open until 10:30. I loved the variety of food and especially the fresh strawberries and raspberries. The 6:00 fresh baked cookies every day are yummy!"
"Hampton Inns are always my first choice when I travel. They are always clean, the staff extremely friendly, the rooms clean and nice, the breakfast delicious. They are an amazing value for the price. There is always a gym and a pool and everything is always well maintained."
"Very clean and exceptional service. Attended a perfect game baseball tournament there and would stay again. The proximity and routes to the various playing fields was convenient. The entire staff here was very hospitable and delivered exceptional service. Some very affordable and great eateries are near by as well as a large Publix grocery. I'll come back here on my... More"
"Nothing to complain about. Very friendly staff and loved it! Diana and Taylor were very helpful. Breakfast was great. Bacon, eggs, hasbrowns, waffles! It was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
"Great menu, service and the food was superb. The Seafood Pescatore over Linguine was tremendous. Drinks and food were very large portions and reasonably priced. All waitresses were tremendous, courteous, friendly and very attentive. Food preparation and quality was fab!!"
"Great place to stay, if you want peace and quiet. The Room 301 was the best. We will be coming back and recommending the Inn by the Lake to all of our friends. The hotel was very clean and located in the nicer Area of Lake Tahoe."
"Before coming to Tahoe and reading the reviews for this hotel, I was skeptical to give this place a try. The reviews said the place was very old and needing of remodeling. We stayed on the third floor in a king room and to say the least everything was amazing. The room was large, comfortable, clean, and all the furniture... More"
"Had a great time"
"I really like this hotel as a first experience in South Lake Tahoe it was pretty good choice, the staff was very friendly and multitasking, the room was clean my family felt good coming to here so I'm happy and sure to make a reservation again in the future, may be with more anticipated time and less cost :) Is...

"We just stayed at the Inn by the Lake for the 4th time and had a great trip. We love the location so we can bike or walk most places. The pool is great and has a two level hot tub! the room is nice and I appreciate having a mini fridge."
"Absolutely the best property and people. We've been coming every Labor Day Weekend for 10 years, plus usually once or twice during the year. For a family reunion there is no better place. The rooms are always pristine, the pool area is a delight, the picnic are and the bowling alley/restaurant on the property makes it ideal. We love it... More"
"So much to like -- beautiful view, close to everything, bowling pizza for kids right there and I especially love that my dog is welcome! It's not much more expensive than the cheap motels around South Lake Tahoe -- shop for the discounts."
"Beds not very comfortable, and the price was quite steep (even realizing it was Labor Day weekend and many Inns raise their rates) otherwise: very clean, well-appointed, convenient to many dining places and lake activities."
"We had a great stay at Inn By The Lake! We stayed in a one bedroom deluxe suite. Great sized living area with well equipped kitchen and a separate bedroom. Sleeper sofa in living room. Bathroom was big with jacuzzi tub. Nice little balcony and huge windows across the living room facing the lake. Room was super clean. A bit... More"
"The stay was great. very pleased with the hotel and its accomodations. The pool area and the dual level hot tub...very relaxing. This hotel had everything around it, especially if you have kids to entertain..bowling ally and ice rink in the back, resteraunt next door with very good breakfast and a ice cream shop with a up stairs popular resteraunt within feet from the hotel. Oh, the Lake, just across the street, very, very NICE!!!"
"Fabulous location. Conference facility, bowling, restaurant, pool, hot tub, and fitness facility all close together AND an incredible view of the Lake. Rooms were easy to get to. My only criticism would be the elevator. It took a long time to move between floors and it abruptly closes the micro second you press the floor button."
"After the manger saw that i was on crutches he moved me to the first floor in the same type of room, which was great for them to do for me. Bed was great, hot tub was awesome, and staff is amazing. Thanks for a great stay!"
"pleasant staff and management. looking forward to staying again. close by fuel, food, and shopping a plus. access to the freeway very easy. Would be nice to have vending and an ice machine on the third floor but overall a nice place to stay."
"First clean comfortable and quiet rooms. Great view from the rooms that are bayside (ask for it) but breakfast area has same great view. Great full breakfast (free). Staff treats you like they are glad you are there and glad they work there . Several really good restaurants are less than .4 miles and .easy walk"
"We were very pleased with our stay. Its worth getting a water view. It has a great view of the bay from the balcony. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. The price is great compared to other water view hotels, and it was worth it. We were a little worried something would be lacking, but that was not the... More"
"At check in, I was welcomed with a smile and told they had upgraded my room. Up to date, clean, and comfortable. I am certain to stay again when in town. Even the staff preparing breakfast had a great attitude this morning."
"I was expecting the type of property from years past, where the quaint experience of Baleens and the exotic decor reigned. Needless to say, it doesn't even resemble what was. The first experience was with a property manager that appeared to come from a different industry, as he was extremely rude and overwhelming. The fancy elegance with the monkey- theme... More"
"I stayed here for an evening during a recruiting trip to the area. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful with anything I needed. They allowed me an early check-in and the rooms were clean and modern. I really liked the lobby and its couches and chairs gave a homey and comfortable vibe to the hotel."
"We've stayed here a few times and love it. The location can't be beat, it's within easy walking distance of down town. Many good restaurants nearby. The staff is super, the hotel is clean and well managed. The lobby is always lively, lots going on, a very up-beat place. Nice bar in the lobby where you can also get snacks."
"I enjoyed my 2 night stay at Aloft, one of my favorite chains. It is a fairly new hotel, so rooms/furnishings were in good shape. I checked in, went up to my room, called down to request a better view, and was immediately given a new room. I spent most of my time out and about, so didn't take advantage... More"
"What a wonderful find. A lovely hotel with superb staff who provide excellent service and make you feel very welcome. Fantastic rooms for the price and spotless. Peter at front of house is a wonderful representative who could do equally as well in a top London Hotel. He was impeccable. Location was only a short walk from seafront and there... More"
"A wonderful place to stay in Santa Barbara. Walking distance of most everything you want to do. Lots of restaurants nearby and William (host) will provide a lot of information about SB and where to eat/what to do. A very nice deluxe continental breakfast with plenty of places to eat outside. Wine and cheese in the afternoon and cookies and... More"
"We stayed in one of their penthouses which had a beautiful private balcony. A nice bedroom, kitchen, and lovely living room. Every evening they have wine and cheese, followed by warm cookies. In the morning they have a lovely continental breakfast in the morning. Several blocks to the beach. Great Location. We stayed 5 days and could have stayed more!"
"The Dana is a vast property with tremendous views of mission bay. Located right on the bay front with excellent water views. Watersports on site. 2 big pools and 2 hot tubs. They have kids movies in the swimming pool area on certain nights. Cons: - Small bathroom / toilet - Small sink - tiny and located outside the bathroom."
"very friendly staff, beautiful resort."
"Our family loves The Dana this was out 5th time staying there. LOVE IT!!"
"Loved our 3 day stay..room very clean (356) very quiet..comfy... Right on the beach steps from the lake. Kayaks (extra charge), surfboards (extra charge). 2 swimming pools. Continental breakfast included. Convenient Rite Aid right across the street and a Safeway a couple blocks walk. Relaxing here is easy."
"One of the reasons we liked the Aqua Beach Inn because it was not one of those humongous hotels, but smaller and homier. It was also very inviting when you first walked in. Easy to unload you suitcases and get to your room which had everything you would need. Gorgeous view of the ocean from your balcony, and close to... More"
"I have stayed here for a month the last two winters Iloved it.the staff is very friendly and helpful I had a refrigerator problem it was addressed immediately rooms are nice rates reasonable million dollar view and great location I will return again"
"We went to the room and it was so nice I went to the desk and reserved the room for an extra day. we were going to leave Saturday but we added that extra night. We left Sunday wishing we could stay longer."
"I've stayed here several times and am always pleased with my stay."
"Great people and location. Very happy I stayed here. Within walking distance of lots of restaurants entertainment ,and bars. The room was very clean and all rooms have a good view. I am looking forward to commit back next year."
"We arrived in the Columbus area very late in the evening/early morning without a reservation thinking we would be able to find a room. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Most hotels were booked around the major interstate area. The Four Points held a room for us at their standard rate, upon arrival we let them know that we were... More"
"My brother and I had the pleasure of staying at this property this past weekend, while in town for a college graduation. The hotel is well maintained and an overall great value for the price. Also the ladies at the front desk were very personable and gave us a warm and friendly welcome. The perks of this hotel include: -Free... More"
"Room is nice but everything else was terrible. First off the hallway smelt like a 1970's hippie convention. Yes I am aware that It's legal in Washington State but I thought no smoking in the hotel would also cover that as well. The worst issue was the free breakfast. The breakfast attendant must have decided to save the hotel... More"
"I had a four day business trip in Tacoma and booked into this hotel. I was very pleased with the accommodations! The room was clean and large enough to be comfortable for staying there for four days. I slept well and the temperature of the room was perfect! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

"I was always happy with Hyatt Place customer service, except for the one time I stay at the Lithonia location. My first bad experience came from the front desk staff. I came there on a slow Monday afternoon (02/08/2016) first time at 12:30. She didn't let me check in. I came back around 2:00 and she still not letting me... More"
"Booked here for family reunion in Clovis. Greeted by Jessa who is very friendly and yet professional. Couldn't find luggage cart at checkin but Tyler searched one out for us and then to my surprise, the maintenance gentleman helped me unload my luggage.

"As a very frequent traveler and IHG member, often my internal hotel expectations are set higher than they should be. A common life error.

We went to the pool area and there were no towels so I called the front desk and towels were brought to us in a matter of minutes. Now that is service with... More"
"Excellent customer service. The purpose of my trip was getting surgery at LSI and the staff at this hotel location was spectacular! They could not do enough for me and my family. Thank you to the entire staff!"

"Very clean, comfortable room. Staff was helpful and attentive. Decent fitness area. The hotel is situated central to some decent restaurants and you can dine on site too. I will stay there again next time I visit."
"Nice place to stay, neat and staff are very homely, corteous, helpful so much so that you dont want to leave. Close to a big Target store for easy shopping. Easy transportation to any part of the city."
"I enjoyed my stay here. Check in was easy and greeted by friendly desk staff. The room was very clean with modern upgrades. The hotel was busy but did not hear anything from the room. I slept well as it was quiet and the beds were very comfortable. The room was bigger than expected. The location was excellent and easy... More"
"We stayed one night here in July with a 10 yr old. The hotel was very clean. Rooms were up to date and comfortable. I slept very well!! They had a nice area outside on a small lake where you could stroll or sit, very relaxing in the morning. Breakfast was impressive for being a continental breakfast. Hot sandwiches, pastries,... More"
"Excellent service from friendly and efficient staff. Sparkling clean room (a little on the small side, but very nice). Enjoyed the Route 66 theme, and photo opp with car out front. Loved the breakfast: all the breakfast items you expect, plus fruit, yogurt, and vegetarian and gluten-free selections, too. Great job!"
"Our stay at Rail Haven was fantastic from the time we checked-in. Upon arrival we were met by a smiling face Adam. He was more than helpful with directions and advice. All other staff members were courteous and polite. The hotel is very well kept, quiet, and is a hidden gem. The outdoor sitting area is a nice relaxing place... More"
"Rail Haven is a superb example of the perfect Route 66 place to stay. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel rooms are clean and decorated in Art Deco design which takes you back in time. Even though on main road, you could not hear the traffic in your room. A very comfortable stay. The continental breakfast in The... More"
"Cool piece of history, but nicely up to date. Friendly staff and reasonable price. A little of the beaten path but worth looking for. The four of us stayed in the family suite. 2 rooms, king bed, queen/ double bunk bed. lots of room, great mattresses."
"Not only is this a great motel, it is also a Route 66 historic icon! The staff is super friendly and service is great. This is my choice hotel when staying overnight in Springfield, MO! If you stay in Springfield then this is the place for you, your family, associates and friends!"
"Filthy hotel. There were long black hairs on our bathroom floor. Candy wrappers and other garbage in the hallways. We were on the second floor and took the stairs. Stay out of the stairwells. They haven't been swept in months. Unfriendly staff.. Parking is across the street in a sketchy parking lot. Our experience was the worst ever. I suggest... More"
"Walked into this tired hotel and was put off. Once I saw blood on the carpet in my room, room 350, I decided it was time to check out. Disgusting! Fortunately, I had some helpful staff at the front desk that gave me a refund so I could run out of there."
"The staff were especially helpful and nice. I showed up at one in the morning and still received a courteous reception. Breakfast in the morning was good as far as continental's go, and the bed was quite comfortable with fresh soft sheets."
"First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place."
"This is the 4th time we have stayed at this location and it is wonderful. Breakfast, wifi and a pool. Its also near all kinds of stores and food! Just fantastic. The staff are also very sweet and caring. :)"
"Enjoyed the stay. Your crew is excellent, in spite of the power outage. Your Happy Hour is very happy, excellent service. The catering company is doing a very nice job of making everybody happy. The front end staff is doing a very good job, the wake-up computer needs to be checked out. The 11:15 PM computer generated wake-up call was... More"
"Staying at a Hampton is great as you know the product no matter where in the world you are. Here however, there is a much more inviting feel. The Sales team is great and Ashlie has always been very helpful when setting up the events here. Plus housekeeping here is top notch thanks to Jerry's efforts! Thank you both and... More"
"One of the nicest Hampton Inns around. Rooms appear to have been refreshed recently. Bath is modern and bright. Room is very clean. Staff is very cordial. Typical breakfast offerings. Be sure to ask for a room facing interior, not street side/freeway. Parking is ample, safe area. Fast food in same parking lot. Room is really nice and it was... More"
"We always enjoy our stays at Hampton Inns and have never spent the night in a bad one. This HI was up to the usual high standard and is a place we feel good to stay. The complimentary breakfast is more than adequate for our needs although a non cheese hot choice would be most welcome. The staff were helpful... More"
"Great Hotel, wonderful location and good shops and GREAT restaurants (not just fast-food) within walking distance! Easy drive to the beaches and to 'outlet-shops' if you wish. Away from the crowds closer to LA."
"We stay here all the time when visiting family in the area. This is my favorite Hampton Inn. Great rooms, super staff, great breakfast, good location close to shops, mountains and beach. The Front Desk always works with us to get us a room that meets our needs. Recently renovated and always clean."
"All of the staff we encountered seemed genuinely interested in making our experience the best possible. They were all very accommodating, starting at the front desk the moment we checked in. There was no pretentiousness whatsoever. How very refreshing."
"Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order."
"Excellence in customer service, rooms and the breakfast provided! Everything is done with such quality and kindness! We occupied 7 hotel rooms while attending a family Thanksgiving. It was unanimous everyone loved the hotel! Thank you Hampton!"
"I was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed at many Hampton Inns and have always been pleased, but this one was a cut above! I like that it was tucked back off the main street and very conveniently located. The room was pristine, while still being inviting and comfortable. The staff was excellent. I will be back!"
"A shopping trip with my cousin. Two day stay at the Hampton. Outlets were close by and we had a very nice stay. We will return. The beds were so clean and comfortable. Breakfast was very good and lots to choose from. Staff was very nice and helpful."
"A little pricy, but it was 4th of July weekend so we totally understand. But the price was well worth it. Martha at the front desk was great! Excellent customer service from her! Always smiled and was so helpful. We loved this hotels location too. We will be back soon ."
"The staff was marvelous and extremely helpful. Our stay ws excellent. We stayed here the night before our wedding with our whole wedding party. Many of our guests chose to stay here as well and we only heard good things about it. The one problem we had with it was that the first time arriving we did get quite lost.... More"
"Good location to highway- easy to get around if you leave before 6am. The breakfast made my day, and the coffee is worth taking a to go cup. People are always at the pool- which is family oriented. The staff is helpful and they have cookies in the evenings."
"Great time clean hotel, love the area, love the fact the room was cleaned and bed was comfortable. Family enjoyed there stay. Great service from staff they was bending over backwards to support our needs."
"Everything was brand new as it was in the last 10 percent of being renovated. As such- it was beautiful. The website picture indicated it was old as they hadn't updated the photo yet so I was more than pleased to see the new remodel! Great location to the outlet malls and breakfast was wonderful."
"The women up front is always friendly and helpful. .. keeps me coming back when they recognize you and greet you by your first name"
"Great place for an extended stay! Enjoy the atmosphere, the staff, and everything around the city there in Port Arthur. Enjoyed the fact that I could use the kitchenette with the room when not wanting to go out to eat all the time when I stayed for a few days. Will definitely stay again when traveling through the area."
"The best place to stay in Lafayette. We will be there again in April next year and are really looking forward to it. It is close to all Shops and Restaurants and of coarse there is the Festival which is the highlight of our trip.There is also Vermillionville, a park with many areas of interest. 5*"
"Took family of 4 (2 adults and 2 tweens) to Lafayette on business. Was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It has a nice floor-plan (we stayed in the one-bedroom with the pull-out sofa sleeper). Location possesses a 'secluded' feel. Every once in a while you'll hear a plane fly overhead or an automobile (if you are outside). Free covered parking... More"

"Our group meets each year and locations have varied across the country. The group member living in the area makes the contacts and hotel selections. Finding a hotel with good price and suited to the needs of our group can be a challenge. After considering approximately 10 hotels in the area with the capability to host our group, we selected...

"Traveling with our High School Varsity Girls Basketball team to a Holiday Tournament this past weekend in Boise I spent two nights at the Oxford Suites and enjoyed it thoroughly. The usual 7 hour drive from Coeur d'Alene took 11 which meant we went straight to our game and checked in late. Hotel staff adjusted beautifully and had everything ready... More"
"We stay here whenever visiting Boise. Good rooms, nice evening reception with two free drinks (with snacks) and great breakfast included with room. They even let us leave our car here for three weeks to save on parking at airport. There is a movie theater across the road and some good restraints available in the neighborhood."
"My visit was like my previous ones. Fantastic. I was welcomed at the front desk by Carolyn. But it didn't end there. All of the Hotels employees I encountered were equally welcoming. And upon entering my room I was greeted by an Oxford Suites coffee mug with a welcome note and chocolate. Thank you Deborah. Breakfast was great. Lacy makes... More"

"This is a great hotel for families. The rooms can accommodate six people comfortably and have a lot of extra space. The staff were friendly and saw to every need.

"Perfect location to visit FAMU. Local eating places were in walking distance. The mall was literally about 3 minutes away. The feel of being in an almost new facility was wonderful. I would recommend this hotel to those traveling to Tallahassee."

"Last minute late night Stay. Hampton Inn claimed no room reserved , yet had the conference room which was done at the same time! This was an awesome find and best suited to extended stay and families. Being a business traveler it was wasted space and added comforts that we did not have the time to enjoy. Would stay here...

"Passing through Tn. And had to stop somewhere for the night.

Once you get past the tobacco spit on the walls and stairs, the Walmart shopping carts, and the dirty stinky clothes hanging on the hand rails you make it to the room. The room smelled like hundreds of cigarettes had been smoked in it and it had never been aired... More"
"I stayed at Baker's for a weekend at the beginning of December. I had a king suite with kitchenette. Full sized refrigerator, two burner stove, fully stocked with everything I needed to do my own cooking. Very nice room, and very clean. The staff are quite welcoming and friendly. They don't have a water park, but do have a nice... More"
"We had a great stay at Baker's Sunset Bay Resort. We loved that we were close enough to the water parks and restaurants but away from all the traffic and craziness of the same. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Wish the beach area was a little bigger, but it's nice they have paddle boats and kayaks you are able to... More"
"Clean and nice rooms. Freindly and knowledgeable staff. There are two pools one inside and outside and both were in great shape and clean. The resort has a nice beach with Kayaks you can use. Very pleasant experience!"
"My husband and I have been coming back to this hotel yearly since 2004. It's great to see that there are things that have stayed the same at the resort, and many things that have improved. It's clear to see the investments that the resort makes to both keep up and maintain what they have, as well as improve other... More"
"Excellent connecting condos for our large group. We did not choose to use the the local amenities, but it was close to the volleyball center which was our purpose of travel. The hotel staff was welcoming and easy to work with when reserving our group rooms."
"I went here over 20 years ago when I was a kid for a family reunion and I was pleased to see it look exactly like it did then. Of course it was updated and very clean. The workers were always maintaining the resort. I love how you have 3 different pool areas. The water inside was a little too... More"
"very nice resort to spend a weekend with a family or just someone special rooms are very nice. around the resort very nice volleyball and small sandy beach but also nice fire pit for the evening. and easy to get to the dells from here. its a must place to check out."
"We were very happy with everything. A Continental breakfast would have been an added value. We would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for grear accommodations and staff not far at all from Wisconsin Dells!"
"I was so disgusted and disappointed with my stay here. The room was dirty and dusty (cobwebs, grime along floor boards, bugs in windowsill), the shower was FILTHY, the entire room was EXTREMELY outdated (carpet all over the walls - floor to ceiling), an accordian door on the bathroom, the sink was loose on the wall, dirt/mildew ring in the...

"Family owns land up in Montello, and my parents always booked here whenever we visited when I was a kid and I still love the place even as an adult myself. Very comfy and the room has this good kind of cozy scent to it. Beds are comfy and rooms are always clean. The maids are always friendly and often... More"
"It was leads than 80 for one night. But the room, the service and the breakfast are top quality. We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we go to Chicago."
"Me and my husband use this hotel for date night several times a year. It's clean and the staff is super friendly. The breakfast is good and it's quiet. The price is ok could be better but you get what you pay for"
"We made our reservation in advance. When we arrived the lobby was very cluttered and dirty . We checked in and paid cash for our rooms. When we entered our room it had a very bad odor. I pulled the bedspread and sheets back and there appeared to be some type of small bugs. The sheets and bedspread either were... More"
"Good breakfast. Very convenient to Dollywood."
"Stayed here 4 nights and were very pleased. Rooms were clean and well appointed.. It was comfortable and quiet. Also very close to everything. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Good breakfast. Would not hesitate to return."
"We called last minute after staying in a cabin that was not very good. They were able to set us up in a queen suite just as big as the cabin and much much cleaner! Love the friendliness of the staff! Would recommend to all friends and family! Plus, this was much cheaper then the cabin. We will stay here... More"
"After visiting family and friends in Woodbury,TN we did as always, off to the mountains. For our needs, this Hampton was the most convenient which accepted pets, close to outlets and the most important, go karts. The outdoor pool was beautiful with a cozy fire pit. We will stay here again."

"Very clean, very polite local English speaking staff. Very good breakfast buffet. Nice outdoor pool. Have stayed several times with (0) complaints. I have stayed other places in Murray, but this is by far the best value overall. I have no reservations recommending this hotel."
"I have been staying at this hotel for 25 years when I am in Murray KY What the hotel lacks in amenities the staff more than makes up for it. From the top down, all are so extremely helpful and cooperative. I love THE UNIVERSITY INN BEST WESTERN!"
"We have stayed at this motel many times while visiting family in Tennessee. I never even consider another motel. We have always been treated very well here. Everyone is considerate and friendly. The prices are just right and the location is convenient for us. I recommend it highly."
"Excellent staff, clean room, easy to check in and out. Great value. The room had wifi which worked well and a great refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and we were able to control the temperature to our liking. We had plenty of towels and washcloths, and they were nice and white and smelled clean."
"I will never stay here again. No elevator. We were located on the second floor, not handicap accessible. I'm not handicap but it's doing a real number on my knee. Sheets are yellow. Cigarette burns in a non-smoking room. Smelled musty. Stains on the chair. Mold on the ceiling above the bed. Dust and cob webs behind the chair. T.V.... More"
"Our first room had an interior door that led to the adjacent room and the lock was broken. So, we asked for another room. The next room smelled like someone had burnt a pack of cigarettes as incense in the room. We booked a non-smoking room. At that point we were just glad to have a room where all the doors locked. I would not stay here again"
"Awesome place, got it at a great deal. Room was spacious and clean, Customer service people were very nice and respectable. Would definitely want to stay again when in that area."
"The lady that works the front desk (who to this day will not tell me her name) was extremely rude to me in regard to my simple request for some water. You can get it our of the sink like everyone else. was her reply to my request Although I couldn't find water suitable for drinking, there was no lack... More"
"It is by far the best Hampton I have stayed at. It is immaculate, new, and staff very helpful. It is always my favorite business trip that I take. It is such a refreshing break from the every day trails"
"Just as expected, Hampton deserves a pat on the back. The staff, facility and accommodations were excellent. This location comes highly recommended and knocked it out of the park. My family will be back the next time we're in Knoxville."
"We had a great visit at the Comfort Suites. The hotel room was spacious (we had a small adjoining 'living room' space in addition to the bedroom), and the room was really clean. The bed was extremely comfortable (great pillows!). We had pleasant interactions with the front desk, who were more than happy to help us with any questions we... More"
"We recently stayed at the Comfort Inn Rensselaer - amazing room and a great staff. We were attending a family wedding and we're treated like family! We will definitely stay there again when visiting Indiana."
"I travel weekly with my career and I generally stay with the Hilton family - most often Hampton. The Hampton in Richmond is a very decent hotel and the staff is courteous. I recommend this hotel and I stay here several times a year."
"DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL. I left my room for an hour after I checked in and someone went in my room and stole my laptop and my suitecase and the hotel took ZERO responsibility for the incident. NOT A SAFE PLACE!!!!I would like to apologize once again for the incident that occurred earlier this month. I have turned over all pertinent documentation to our Risk Management department. Any future correspondence will be addressed by our Risk Management Team."
"This hotel was originally a livery back in the 1860s and it has all the character and charm a boutique hotel should have. A manager there told us the support beams and posts were from the original building- very cool. The rooms were large and designed with an antique flair and each room was attributed to a Florida governor so... More"
"Had issues with checkin in everyone was backed up there is two seperate hotels across a busy street from one another . Tbe hotel is in the hood . Key didnt work clean up lady was more help than the front desk staff. Get a name brand hotel maybe a few minutes further away from downtown than this place."
"I was a little worried upon driving up to the hotel, as the outside looked a bit rundown. Upon entering however, it was like stepping back in time. Absolutely beautiful lobby area! Staff were very attentive and helpful. Room was very nice as well. Restaurant (Envoy) had the best brunch I've ever had -- they do small plates instead of... More"
"We enjoyed our stay, the staff was friendly and helpful with info about where we were visiting. We had dinner at the Envoy which was delish and then drinks in the lounge. We will be sure to return on our next visit to the city!"
"When I brought photos of dried vomit to the front desk they were dismissive. They asked if the sheets were dirty or stained. Need I say more. Sticky stuff on nightstand. Security guards on the floors and security cameras everywhere. Especially as young women, be safe and stay somewhere else."
"Unfortunately the furnature and decor is from the late 1960s or early 1970s and it also appears it hasn't been kept up since then. They allow pets but unless everything else is booked, as it was for me, I will not return to this place."
"I just love being in this hotel every time i come to Madison im staying at the Magnuson Grand hotel.. Great breakfast even better pool. The service is just great all around.My kids love getting in the swimming pool and i love the fitness room."
"We had a great stay at this hotel. Super nice and helpfull staff that made this stay special. Enjoyed free wine tasting with a nice girls in the lobby and live music. Worth it price and location for the hotel! Will definitelly come back to stay :)"
"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere."
"Booked for 2 days for a family vacation while in miami ..big mistake.

"The hotel was really nice even if rooms were small and the beds were so cozy it was like being in s best!! The pool was nice and clean and we had no problems getting a beach chair their. The beach was amazing !!! It was clean and had nice white sand!!!!"
"Too bad I was out doing so many things in Miami that I barely had a chance to actually go to the beach, but finally the evening before we left, I partook of the large hot tub, then easily walked to the beach (there are a few steps so not easy to do if you have a stroller). The sandy... More"
"Great group of guys running the jet-skis!!!! We had a blast and felt very safe! Love the fact they were so close to our hotel! Definitely will return."
"Hotel provides a list of restaurants nearby. this has nothing to do with the hotel, but be wary of delivery in this area, the food pretty much sucks - at least the chinese and pizza. The hotel is awesome. Shuttle will take you anywhere you need to go nearby. Hotel was service was spot on. Loved my room. Cannot go wrong with Hyatt Place. Clean, Comfy, spacious, reasonably priced. Highest recommendation."
"Great hotel, very friendly desk personnel. You should note online and on phone that your free hotel shuttle is for dfw only. I called and confirmed that I was flying in but no one asked me which airport, I had to take a 30 cab each way. That would have made a difference in my choice of hotels or flights."
"I enjoyed my short stay at Hyatt Place. The hospitality was really good and my good experience started with the interaction with the Hyatt shuttle driver. He was very nice and warm in helping me. The hotel staff were very good as well carrying a warm smile on their face and always available to help. The quality of the rooms... More"
"My stay here was awesome. Stayed here to break up my journey and got a good night's rest. Really friendly staff."
"Such a great experience! We traveled as a hockey team, and the team at Hyatt Place was so accommodating! First, my room wasn't ready (at 10 a - check-in is far later), so they got out some cold breakfast items for my son to keep us occupied until it was ready. The rooms were clean, modern and spacious. At the... More"
"The staff was amazing. The toom was a nice size. We had a king sized bed with a pullout sofa so 4 can sleep comfortably"
"We stayed here after our wedding and was not disappointed. This is definitely the nicest option in town, so it was great for our occasion, but it's also affordable when looking for a staycation or just passing through Tulsa."
"Good accessible location. Very comfortable beds. Good breakfast offering. Verrrrrry accommodating staff. Good exercise and technology facilities. Close proximity to PIE airport. All positive on any criteria that I use to evaluate a hotel, particularly including price. Also close to some excellent golf courses."
"Worth staying here - great breakfast."
"Last-minute online reservation and it was perfect. Front desk staff gave us a discount after finding out we were military. We asked about breakfast time since our flight was early (7am) and we were informed it started at 6am, but we could just ask morning staff and they could get us something to eat (more later). Also, less than 5... More"
"We booked the hotel for a two night stay. When we entered the hotel room, we were satisfied with space. We were surprised no extra blankets and pillows were in the room for pull out sofa bed.

"We had a great stay. Had to stay at this hotel after checking into and out of a different hotel due to issues at the property. We should have just found this hotel first and stayed here.

Thank you for your business, and we look forward to seeing you again in the future."
"Great hospitality. Bent over backwards to help. Accommodation great, staff great. Everything expect from Marriott. Would definitely stay here again when coming back. Academy 12-15 minutes away. Plenty of choices for food nearby"
"We found ourselves without a room and driving from Philadelphia to Virginia over Memorial Day weekend.

"I would stay here again. The ease of highway access to downtown and local nearby places to catch a quick bite or drink. Darcy's, just a walk around the corner is a good place to catch lunch or dinner. The Pub has that bistro type environment with open air settings. Couldn't have planned a better place to stay for our... More"
"Nice quiet area with restaurants within driving distance. The staff are pleasant, courteous and professional. It would be a little hard to find without a GPS, but not daunting with it. Would stay here again."
"Beautiful part of Denver. Easy access to freeways and so, to other parts of town. Nice choice of restaurants, and grocery stores. Enjoyed having a room with a kitchenette. Mostly appreciated the friendly and helpful staff. Easy five stars all around for this property."
"Great"
"The weather was horrible for our weekend in Denver, but the hotel made a nice difference. The staff was very nice and helpful. The room was comfortable and clean. I would especially like to thank Kerry at the front desk for working so hard to make sure everything was right!"
"We stayed there for only one night (thank goodness!) a couple of days ago.The reception staff, especially Kris, were good. However, that's where the good ended. The room was dingy and old - paint chipped, moldy smelling, etc. There was something stuck on the edge of the nightstand (pic). The TV remote was disgusting (pic) - I didn't want to... More"

"My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!"
"I really like the hotel, the location was nice. Definitely the best choice, last year I went to Colorado and we stayed in Denver at Hyatt hotel, the hotel was good but at Hyatt they charge for parking, breakfast and wifi, and at the Holiday Inn Express this all free. I will pickup the Holiday Inn Express again for future vacations."
"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.  For a budget hotel, the surroundings were clean, freshly painted, and we commented that the bedding was the most comfortable of any we'd slept in.  We would definitely recommend this hotel."
"Weather was cold but we enjoyed the visit. I resent being forced to do this to enable your marketing. 50 words Minimum indeed!"
"Very comfortable, but location was not the best. Hotel in general was nice and clean."
"Great staff and well taken care of facility!"
"Free parking, included wifi, and one of the best breakfasts I have seen at this type of hotel. What's not to like? The location is pretty convenient, and the pool (while small) is a nice addition. It's not a place to hang around all day, but works great. The rooms also have microwaves and refrigerators."
"I enjoyed my experience. Easy to get to (off US 17, a.k.a. the Crosstown)."
"My husband and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was packed but that didn't seem to affect the staff. They were very friendly, attentive and accommodating. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful-full of choices and whenever they got low on something a staff member came and changed it out. I will be staying there again next time I vacation to Charleston!"
"We stopped over here on our way to Florida. Very pleasant experience and close to downtown historic district. We enjoyed our 1 night stay."
"There was nothing real close to walk to, but a short cab ride to a lot of places."
"Loved it - I had not stayed in one of these before. I'll definitely use this hotel again."
"The hotel staff were so helpful and friendly. The free breakfast was very good. There is a nearby shuttle to the historic district but they do not run late at night. However, Taxi fares are reasonable."
"Everyone was very friendly! Room was clean & comfy."
"Very friendly staff. Free coffee in the lobby, and breakfast Buffett. Loved the decor! The only downside was the limited parking and how far it was from downtown"
"We loved our stay here! It was a clean and brand new facility with all the great amenities... free wifi, great pool, breakfast in the morning, friendly and helpful staff. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone. It's in a great location too! Right next to the highway and just a quick 5-10 minute drive to downtown Charleston (King Street, The Battery, etc.) I would definitely stay here again!"
"The Monterey Hyatt clean, spacious rooms and great location, and staff was very helpful and friendly. Location is perfect and easy access to Cannery Row and restaurants, would definitely stay here again."
"Better than expected ,big room with sofa bed,walking distance to beach,new building,great breakfast."
"The room was great, but breakfast was not great."

"This wonderful little motel is a fabulous place to stay. The rooms are cozy and very clean. If you can stand trains, you might want to find another town to stay in. Best not a chain motel I've ever seen."
"The room was clean. The staff was kind. There was a complimentary hot breakfast that included waffles and scrambled eggs, coffee and yogurt. The hotel is located next to a shopping mall and is not far from restaurants. My daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool. I would stay here again."
"The airline put me here when weather delayed my flight and I missed the connection. The place is not well maintained in general. I will put up with a lot, but when a dozen cockroaches run out of the room when I opened the door, I'm out. This place should be condemned."
"I had no heat the carpet was dirty. There were dead bugs everywhere. No iron or ironing board. Smelled of smoke. The arm of the chair had been eating by a dog. Will never go back."
"This was a great place to stay it was clean plenty of clean towels and I was able to wash our beach clothes. It was only 10-15 min away from Destin and the great selection of breakfast was great my kids loved the waffle maker. Very spacious rooms and affordable"
"The staff at Comfort Suites is very accommodating, and easy to work with. I had to extend my stay, and they were happy to help me. Also, the breakfast is probably one of the best that I have had in a hotel buffet very tasty."
"We wanted a hotel a little away from the beach to help cut costs. This was a great choice! The hotel was clean, comfortable beds, staff very friendly, and a great continental breakfast. They even had lemon water and cookies available in the afternoons. If we ever go back to this area, I will choose this hotel again!"
"We came to visit my stepmother to celebrate her 92nd birthday. Nice, clean and quiet.Unfortunately she had been sent to a hospital out of town. The room was clean and the staff was smiling and very professional.Breakfast was good. Loved having my own coffee pot. Plenty of plugs for charging devices."
"We picked this hotel out of convenience and the fact that it had a pool close to the Punta Gorda airport. We had one of the best evenings hanging out at the tiki bar next-door, around the pool with our kids, and at the hotel bar that night. Everyone was super friendly, hotel room was very clean and unique compared... More"

"Beautiful property located right on the water. Tiki bar was awesome! Live music and great drink specials. Breakfast buffet was a little disappointing. The rooms are clean and the decor is nautical themed."
"The whole experience was fantastic, very enjoyable and relaxing. All of the staff were super to deal with. The drinks were good and the food was super. Having a paper each day was very good along with excellent internet service."
"We stayed over night so we could catch an early flight the next morning. The motel provided transportation to the airport. They were so nice about it! They gave us a free sample beer the night before, and free coffee the next morning. We would have been given breakfast, too, but we had to leave too early."
"The four seasons is the best hotel choice in Punta Gorda. Location close to down town, the marina and the path along the harbor is nice. The ability to walk across the parking lot and sit in a chair in the sand and enjoy the harbor and a drink and a bite is wonderful."

It was our first stay at The London, and I am positive we will be going back the next time we find ourselves on the west coast. The room was great and felt spacious even for four guests. The complimentary breakfast was... More"
"Room lovely. Staff lovely. Pool amazing. Slow service on the roof bar - I waited 30 mins for a drink on a less than busy bar on Saturday night.... Oh and the paid parking and continental breakfast isn't justified really considering the price. But I am giving 5 stars regardless because I did love it so much. Would def come... More"
"My husband and I wanted a weekend getaway in the city we live in as we are too busy with work to actually go anywhere and wanted a special place to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary, so we chose The London as our staycation! Let me go ahead and preface that we have stayed at The Mondrian, The Standard,... More"
"Very large rooms, well decorated, large bathrooms. Public spaces are chic. Rooftop pool and restaurant are scenes and fun. Not too stuffy. Nicest upper end hotel in area. Definitely now my go to on West Side"
"The London is my favorite West Hollywood Hotel. It's private (just off the Sunset Strip). It's high class elegance and sophistication with a nice dose of hip. The staff is amazing. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable. The pool deck has an amazing view of Weho and is amazing people watching, all the hip and glamour people are here!"
"Great little hotel. Front desk staff was great with recommendations to nearby restaurants etc. Noise was not bad at all. Had a room with an outside view. Was very clean and the bathroom was nice as well as the shower. There was a Starbucks right downstairs inside the hotel for coffee in the morning. The bar and lounge looked really... More"
"Nice hidden gem that places you right in the proper spot for walking. A nice bar inside that opens at 5pm. A Starbucks for snacks. Neat office area for working. Great use of building. Winter pricing is great. Parking is in a garage nearby. It does cost about 30 dollars a day with validation. Staff is friendly, areas clean. Well... More"
"We booked a night here completely last minute when we were at a Red Sox game. We got the pricing through Expedia and couldn't have been happier. The room was clean and pretty roomy for a boutique hotel. We had the view of some water and Fanuiel Hall Marketplace. You really can't beat the location of this hotel, it's within... More"
"This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. The staff is excellent and gave us some great suggestions for dinner. We got an interior room again. The room is nice, small but very clean. I have read reviews about the lighting and no windows. The rooms lighting for fine for us. We did not see a problem. We... More"
"Stayed here for a night on a stop over in Boston. The hotel was very clean and easy to find plus close to a load of restaurants and bars. When I arrived there seemed like there was a party going on in the hotel bar which made me think I was in for a loud and uncomfortable night. However once... More"
"i really like this place. The food was quite good and the service is very nice. They have a shuttle that works very well for short trips. All in all - it is a motel that has been refurbished, but the rear part is actually quite nice and the rooms are big and quiet. I'd definitely stay here again."
"We stayed here to see a show at Pechanga. The casino was about 20 minutes away. The hotel was freeway close. Everyone at this hotel was super friendly. The rooms were clean and the breakfast very good and fresh. Unfortunately, I did not get to use the pool but it was clean as well."
"Could not fault the Carneros Inn - although high end, worth every penny. The Boon Fly Cafe is great for breakfast, but exceptional for dinner. Does great cocktails and their Fried Chicken was the best I've ever had."
"This has become the only place that we stay when visiting the Napa area. It is like your own little private escape with beautiful grounds, great food and all the amenities. we came with three other couples and had a great time."
"Carneros Inn offers the perfect balance of privacy, Excellent service, great food and luxurious accommodations. And the location is perfectly situated in Carneros, which is cooler and close to both Napa and Sonoma."
"My husband and I spent 5 days there for our honeymoon. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel special and welcomed. The views were breathtaking. The location was perfect. Lisa with concierge literally made our trip. Carneros will always hold a special place for us!"
"The name inn really does not represent them and devalues their name. Resort would probably fit better because of all the amenities and all that they have to offer. We were married there in 2012 and stayed there multiple times since 2010, so maybe we are biased)"
"The property was beautiful. It was a perfect getaway spot for a busy couple looking to unplug. Highly recommend the cottage with the outdoor tub and shower - it was wonderful. The restaurants on the property were also great."
"Second time staying at this property. Beautiful setting. Cottage experience makes you feel like your home away from home. The private patios with heaters and outdoor showers are a treat. All the dining venues are delicious."
"We stayed at the Carneros Inn during a 3 day vacation with friends. This place is very special and unique.. Each room is an individual bungalow with hardwood floors, a private patio and fireplace in each room. It's very romantic, peaceful and relaxing. My only complaint about the room was the heater was incredibly loud when it would turn on... More"
"Loved everything about it. Rustic feel, but 5-star comfort and great staff!! Will definitely visit again, next time for a longer stay. Not a great place to visit with little ones, but for a couples retreat it is fantastic. Thee was a wedding there when we visited and they dominated the Hilltop Pool (and they were very LOUD) so we... More"
"Everything was perfection. We got away for 3 nights, parked the car when we arrived, and didn't use it again until we left. (We did hire a limo one day ...) The Concierge set us up with the most amazing high end wine tasting and lunch on day 2, and the spa was top notch. We cannot wait to go... More"
"Perfect stay. I really enjoyed my time here. It is close to the grey hound bus stop. It is quiet. For the price, it is an amazing place. 40.00 is great considering it's close to downtown and ybor city. Thete is grocery and convenience stores and laundry all within walking distance. I was even able to find some green."
"I checked in my room at about 5pm and after I paid money ave entered my room it was horrible. I left rode around until about 12am. The room had roaches crawling, they had moth balls in the drawer, under the mattress, under the bed. I kept itching sleeping in the bed so I laid in the hard floor, I... More"
"This hotel is awesome from the staff to the rooms. Very clean rooms very friendly staff I had the pleasure of meeting Keith and Yiria they were at the front desk at checkout both made me feel great told me to come back and visit soon and experience the new brand that they will become soon. Breakfast was good as... More"
"Great place to stay. Our daughters softball team participated in the OKC challenge we attended the women's college World Series. Hotel was not centrally located but we didn't mind driving around. Hotel was clean, AC worked well beds were soft. Very good quality for what we paid."
"Staff greets you by name. Clean and spacious rooms. The hotel is in the center of Caesars and convenient for walking throughout the propertype. Also easy to get to other hotels whether walking or by cab."
"We stayed in Nobu which is a great location in Caesars Palace. Rooms are a bit smaller than the Augustus Tower where we usually stay. The room is well appointed and the bed is soooo comfortable. The free coffee and water is a nice touch."
"I can't say enough great things about this hotel! I was in Kauai for a scientific conference and I was pushing the budget staying here, but it was WELL worth it. They have so much to do and so many activities and areas to explore that I didn't feel that I needed to pay for activities outside of the resort.... More"
"We were warmly greeted with leis upon arrival at the resort. Most nights the driveway is lined with tiki torches, and there are two gorgeous ponds in front of the hotel with a waterfall, black swans and ducks. The hotel itself resembles a palace with marble and exotic plants everywhere. One of the first things you see from the lobby... More"
"This is a beautiful resort with great customer service. Prices in the restaurants are quite high, but quality is excellent. We attended the conference and enjoyed our stay. We would highly recommend this resort to families. Salt water pool, lazy river, live entertainment, beautiful and clean rooms, and of course, Hawaiian weather.. Five stars."
"We had a wonderful time on our 25th anniversary. We highly recommend this hotel and their staff including the Front desk, Consear, bellhops, valet and all the people working the restaurants(5) etc. We especially enjoyed the saltwater pools.. this is definitely a five star atmosphere - very Ohana! Thanks to Expedia for allowing us to book this trip on line from the comfort of her own home. Mahalo"
"We had a wonderful time at the hyatt kauai. The property is beautiful, we hardly left! The restaurants are great, there's live entertainment and our daughter loved the Kids camp. We only planned on dropping her off one day but she asked us to please send her one more day :) we are definitely coming back!"
"My wife and I celebrated our 20th anniversary at the Grand Hyatt. We stayed here for our honeymoon, and it was just as good, if not better two decades later. The location is beautiful, the rooms are attractive and well kept, and the service is excellent. I recommend it 100."
"We have visited the Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort and Spa for the past 10 years, and each time we visit this OUTSTANDING property, I walk away say, If I could live here in as the general manager on this property, I would do it in a heart beat! As a Lifetime Diamond member, the entire Hyatt staff, does an OUTSTANDING... More"
"The resort is very well cared for and the views are awesome. The staff goes out of their way to anticipate your needs. The few minor, minor issues we had were addressed immediately and the resolution always always exceeded expectations. Pacific Dreams did a great photo shot. Our photographer Phil was fun and kept the kids engaged. He got some... More"
"I don't want to be repetitive - but have no hesitation in staying at this hotel. It is a wonderful hotel, and the grounds are spectacular. We stayed in Room 5048 - I was concerned as this was over one of the restaurants, but noise was never a problem. The view was wonderful, we could hear the surf, and the... More"
"We spent 6 days at this lovely resort and everything about it was terrific. We were upgraded to a suite at the far western part of this sprawling resort and had a lovely view of the ocean. It was a long (10-minute) walk to the main area where the restaurants, pools and activities were located but we enjoyed strolling outside.... More"
"Just finished four nights around Thanksgiving and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel (see Westin Princeville review - that hotel is good but I prefer this one) tremendous service and facilities ROOMS - we took advantage of a Hyatt sale and got a suite that was over-the-top fantastic so not sure it's comparable (suite here was much better than 1 bedroom at... More"
"Our trip was a gift from our wonderful Son to celebrate our 46th wedding anniversay/Honeymoon. Staying at the hotel was absolutely marvelous. All aspects of our stay were well attended and provided for. Something that not too many peope review on is the Island and it's People itself. I have to say that going out from the fantastic resort to... More"
"We had a great visit. The resort was designed to be what you imagine hawaii to look like - great sunrise - great sunset - staff dedicated to making you happy. No complaints at all. My daughter loves sitting by the pool, jumping off the rocks, switching to the hot tub, and then having a lava flow. Does it get... More"
"We stayed here for a week just after Christmas with a family of 5. We booked two inter-connecting rooms, both had a king and a queen which was very comfortable for 5 people. We didn't book an ocean view room and overlooked the garden, in the Shipwreck Wing near the tennis courts - the outlook was fine. We booked this... More"
"Wonderful location and view. Food and services are excellent. Convenient to other areas of Kauai. We drove to many other areas of the island and found it very easy to get around. Any time we asked for information at the hotel they were very willing to help."
"We chose the Grand Hyatt Kauai for the first here nights of our honeymoon in Hawaii. It was amazing - the staff were super helpful, the grounds are amazing and the food was great. In particular, the sushi at Stevensons Library is probably the best we've had (the tempura roll epic). Dinner at Tidepools was pretty good, a bit... More"
"We arrived at the Grand Hyatt after staying at another resort on the Big Island which was lovely, but we were blown away by this facility - Grand indeed! Location was beautiful and the staff was excellent (with the exception of one bartender who wasn't interested in waiting on us.) The restaurants on premise had excellent food and beverages. After... More"
"We stayed here 3 nights in March while on a week long trip of Hawaii. It was wonderful in every way. When you enter the lobby, the backdrop is an open air view of the Ocean. It is magnificent. Breakfast is delicious and the service beyond terrific. We sat over looking the Ocean and saw whales on two mornings. Nothing... More"
"Whenever we travel I'm always on the hunt for small/intimate/boutique style hotels. I loved this place! Great style, friendly staff and the cutest breakfast delivered to your room in a picnic basket every morning. Did I mention the rooms are massive We booked two rooms, ours was slightly larger than my in-laws but both we're comfortable and spacious. We'll definitely... More"
"This is, by far, one of the most beautiful, well-appointed clean places I've ever stayed. The staff was exceptional, polite, helpful and friendly. Brian took extra efforts to ensure our stay was perfect. He even took us on a tour of the other side of the hotel. One side (where I stayed) was very modern while the other side was... More"
"The one bedroom suite was outstanding. Private roof top patio. Responsive and hospitable staff from the front desk to the housekeepers. Gratis wine and cheese in the lobby before going out for dinner and port upon returning. Breakfast delivered to the room in a picnic basket at precisely the time I requested. I had to depart for the airport at... More"
"We recently stayed at this fantastic property in Downtown Charleston for a weekend to attend a wedding reception of a close friend's son. Our son attends the College of Charleston so Restoration on King is perfectly located to visit with him and to have fun shopping on King Street. The setup of the room was perfect and we enjoyed the... More"
"Our first trip to Charleston could not have gone better especially with the accommodations, service and staff at this hotel. Rooms are perfect, updated and clean. Location is easily walkable to shopping, dining and historic interests. I cant see a reason why I would stay anywhere else on our next trip to Charleston. Highly recommend The Restoration. Only complaint I... More"
"Our stay at The Restoration exceeded our expectations. The employees were friendly and eager to meet our every need. Lots of perks. Rooftop restaurant, swimming pool, extraordinary breakfast, and spacious suites. Thanks for making our stay luxurious!"
"This is a delightful hotel. We were deciding between this and The Spectator when booking, and chose this because of the pool and the promise of a little more room than a standard room, at a significantly lower price than rooms at the Spectator were going for at the time. We were very happy. Our welcome was warm, they got... More"
"Very cool place to stay. Great location. The breakfast in picnic baskets was a great touch. Lots to do! Bikes provided for getting around the area. Rooftop bar and nightly wine tastings. Nice rooftop pool. The employees were super friendly. We will be back."
"My husband and I stayed here in June for part of our honeymoon. We had a long drive and had a late check in. When we arrived, we were informed that we had received a complimentary upgrade to a luxury suite over-looking King Street. The staff showed us the ropes around the hotel and our bedroom with tips on what... More"
"My wife and I stayed two nights in a studio room in the new wing. Great room,spacious, large walk in shower, king size bed, large tv microwave, refrigerator and sink area. Safe in a bottom drawer ( though we were lucky to find it since no one told us about it). Great amenities- wine and cheese at 5PM, cookies with... More"
"We have stayed at ROK each of the past two years on our way back home from our summer vacation on HHI. ROK is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at. The historic building is amazing, the home-like feel of the reception area is wonderful, the original wood floors are perfect. And I haven't even mentioned the... More"
"I had my daughters party at the Ramada Hall. The staff was pleasant and professional the Manager Terrie Cowen, she went above and beyond and if it were not for her this whole party could have been a disaster. All I can say is if you want a clean hotel, quality service and a professional staff look no further then... More"
"The customer service from Tim, Ashley and Ingrid was awsome and they went above and beyond to help answer questions and resolve a issue. The Hotel is superbly kept and it was a pleasure to stay here. They treated us with the utmost respect and kindness."
"My girlfriend and I stayed at this location last night for a concert and we had such a great time. We took the complimentary shuttle over to the venue which was only 3 miles away. Our shuttle driver, Patricia, was so friendly and funny. We really appreciated her great customer service and getting us to the venue quickly as we... More"
"Very nice area. There was a great Italian restaurant with in walking distance."
"This is a very nice hotel. Immaculate, comfortable great breakfast. With a professional welcoming staff in a good location. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay again."
"Nice, clean, comfortable and affordable, all with a great hot breakfast and close to GMU. Wish they had an outdoor pool, but much better than local competitors."
"Everything about our stay was very good to excellent. Although we did not spend at lot of time at the hotel as we were visiting family in the area, out experiences with dining and the room itself were most satisfactory and the Christmas decor of the lobby areas made us miss being at home at little less. Excellent experience for... More"
"The hosts were friendly and welcoming. They were available to answer any of my concerns or needs."
"One night - SUPER Comfortable, the staff very pleasant. Unless you're featured on the Lives of the Rich and Famous, this hotel has every comfort and amenity you need or want."
"I booked two nights at the Inn through Expedia however, I was incorrectly charged to my personal card. If this issue had been resolved in a timely fashion, it wouldn't have been a deal breaker however, after the refund of the mistaken charge, I was once again charged on the 29th of December, a full 10 days after I stayed... More"
"Room was very clean and quiet. Beds were extremely comfortable to sleep in. All staff we interacted with were polite and friendly. We will definitely look to stay at The Inn on any future visit to the area."
"This Home2 is a great find if you're looking for a great place to stay in Greenville. Walk to some really fun restaurants, easy access to the interstate and an easy drive to downtown Greenville. The hotel is warm, friendly, the rooms are spacious and not crowed with lots of collateral -- lots of counter space and a fridge, microwave... More"
"Staff welcomed, room sharp crisp quiet clean and all ready to go. Convenient access. Upon check in I was able to get a discount using on line booking which the staff advised me of. When I was given a HUGE room and wanted a little smaller they jumped to it. Note, rooms like 110, 210 .. get a lot of... More"
"From check-in until check-out, this was a fantastic experience. The room was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were amazing. I will definitely stay with Home2 Suites by Hilton again!"
"I've been traveling for business for fourteen years (about every other week), and this was the best stay I've ever had. (That's not an exagerration this was the BEST stay that I can remember.) The site was brand new and spotless. The staff was extremely friendly. The location was perfect for my work, and plenty of dining options nearby. Because... More"
"The rooms were very spacious. The beds were very comfortable. The breakfast was tasty with a variety of items from breakfast sandwiches, cereal, oatmeal, waffles, bagels, various juices, fruit, and yogurt. The amenities were plenteous. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will return when we come back to the area."
"I loved this quirky hotel and it's modern feel. Our room was very large and my husband and I appreciated the curtain that separated the king bed from the couch bed where our kids were sleeping. Breakfast was typical for a Hilton...they had the breakfast sandwiches that heat up in the special 1234 microwaves (dummy proof/kinda)...and it's all in the... More"
"I should have checked Trip Advisor before booking on Agoda. I selected for location and price for which I was satisfied. BUT this place is a real treat. The plastic wrap over the mattress first caught our eye, then the lack of a blanket, poor quality towels, old AC unit with poor controls, and very minimal service - in 4... More"
"The towels were stained. The comforter had burn holes in it. The tub grips were starting to turn black. And there were bugs in the bed. My sister and I ended up sleeping on top of the covers because it was a holiday weekend and nowhere else had vacancies."
"This is the quietest hotel I have ever stayed in. A bit out of the way, but well worth the hunt. Everything was spotless, the tv was great. This would be a great location from which to tour the distilleries and/or visit Mammoth Cave. We arrived very late (11pm) but check-in was fast and efficient. Beds were extremely comfortable and... More"
"Hotel was clean, staff was friendly! Would definitely stay here again. We were traveling with three kids, and the pool was nice to play in and the hot tub was nice to relax in. Used laundry facilities as well, and they were clean and inexpensive. Hotel was quiet and centrally located to the attractions we were there to see. Great... More"
"Great stay! We spent the night here on way down to Atlanta. We arrived late and we didn't have reservations, they had king suite available which we took. The room was very nice, spacious, very clean, comfortable bed. The check in staff was very friendly and helpful. Hot breakfast in the morning was good, nice selection-scrambled eggs, sausage patties, biscuits,... More"
"The lobby of the hotel looked like an old-fashioned inn -- should have taken a picture, but it was something a little fun and different on a long road trip. Room was clean and well-kept, breakfast was fresh with lots of choices. They had a movie my kids happened to love playing in the breakfast area, which was a welcome... More"
"This is our first time at the Bowling Green Drury Inn. We stayed at one previously and really like the service, rooms, kickback dinner and breakfast buffet that Drury offers. After a long day traveling, it is nice to kickback and not have to look for a place to eat. Salad, soup, options to make a simple dinner, plus nacho... More"
"We stayed here on our way down to Florida. The hotel was nice and the staff was super helpful. The only problem we had was that the fridge in the room wasn't working in our room but the staff took care of it very quickly and provided us with a new fridge. Everything was clean, the beds were comfortable, overall... More"
"Hotel was excellent. Staying a second night and getting the room over forty dollars cheaper without booking through hotels dot com was even better. Lesson learned."
"This Drury is AWESOME! The staff is super friendly and attentive. Could not ask for more in terms of the food, breakfast and the 5:30 Kickback (especially the mac and cheese, mmmmm). Location is convenient to restaurants (several within walking distance) and shopping. I have to go to the local hospital for work and the Drury is within 5 miles... More"
"There is nothing I can say about this place. Stuck here for a convention. Poor service, Poor food quality. Bathrooms are at least 15-20 years old. Water issues. Maid service not even close to daily. Entire property is dirty. I would not stay here again if it were free"
"I called to make a reservation to book for two days to attend for a convention and spoke with Rick. While he's taking to me I told him about the special package I wanted to avail and he said he will put me on hold for just a seconds. Guess what 25 minutes on hold so I called on my... More"
"My family travelled to Anaheim for the winter break 2014. Now I know we only paid an average of 119 per night and i do not expect luxury at this price but I do expect things to work and the room to be clean. The room was gross. The outlets were falling out of the walls. They obviously do not... More"
"I took my family for a fun filled 4th of July weekend at Disney and we ended up very ill due to mold allergies. The bathroom had extensive mold under the wallpaper and in the grout in the tub. Both my wife and I have allergies to mold and we became very ill and spent the day in bed sick... More"
"Nice, clean, beautiful and everybody was very helpful and they provided the best customer service!!!"
"I am on a business trip. The service is like dial up. I already changed rooms to get a signal. I am using my Iphone to connect. Talked to someone from their ISP named Kevin. Completely worthless. Never called me back and didn't fix a thing,"
"We took a few days and made a weekend trip to Lexington. We always try to stay with Motel 6 as they allow pets. This location is a little old and needs updating, but it was clean and the staff was great! For the price it was just what we needed!"
"Overall stay was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The coffee was great! Typically I do not care for hotel coffee - it was probably the best hotel coffee I've had this side of Europe.Dear laylemsp, Thank you for your stay and a great review. We are glad you enjoyed our clean and comfortable room. Our staff are constantly undergoing training to provide 'Premier' guest service. Look forward to hosting you here again soon. Sincerely, Gracie Guest Services Manager"

"Great hotel! You'll enjoy it very much! Breakfast is over-the-top, great service, rooms are very big, very clean. Lou and Amber make breakfast a pleasure--great service, much pride---this is a go-to location when visiting Katy, TX."
"This is a fabulous hotel. Very reasonably priced. Very clean comfortable beds. Breakfast was very good. Everything you could want including omelets. All of the staff is helpful and friendly. You will enjoy ."
"Clean and nicely appointed. Rooms are a good size and up to date .. Breakfast is hot with plenty of food that you would expect to see. with a nice cheerful and clean eating area. Service is very good (we had a room changed due to a noisy neighbor , which sure isn't the hotels fault) Of course there are... More"
"Our family stayed two nights at this location. It was our first time staying at a Home2 and we were pleased with the inviting lobby, spacious, and very clean room. The most memorable part of our trip though was the hospitality shown by the front desk staff and breakfast attendant. Tonya was so helpful and friendly, leaving me with the... More"
"Amazing experience for our kids and parents who stayed. They hours of amenities were perfect and very well laid out. It seemed that no one was left wanting for anything. Front desk and support staff, AWESOME! Speaking with one of the managers, very nice and I noted that I had spoke with her the night before around 10:30pm and she... More"
"Just a stop over on way from south Fla. To Myrtle Beach. Love Savannah and this hotel."
"I have never been disappointed by a Hampton Inn and this one maintains that track record. The staff was helpful and friendly. The rooms and most importantly bathrooms were clean and smelled nice. And the price was right. For my purposes the location was convenient, so I have no complaints."
"On military duty loves the room. This was not my first stay. Accommodations are impeccable and the staff is not only professional but pleasant. Any concerns or issue are addressed immediately. Satisfied"
"This hotel gives you what you would expect from Holiday Inn Express clean comfortable quiet rooms, friendly staff, breakfast good including hot and cold selections, fresh fruit. Nice pool and hot tub"
"The hotel is hidden off the main highways but close to many business locations. Parking is either valet or paid controlled self park. The staff greeted us with a positive attitude and acknowledged our Elite status immediately. The Concierge Lounge was well staffed also and provided several amenities, however it is only open Monday through Friday. Our room was comfortable... More"
"Not happy because when I got there this was like the umpteenth time that I made a reservation through Hotels.com and not get what I reserved!!!. Makes me want to never use Hotels.com again. The room was run down, snags in the carpet, snags in the towels and sheets. And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it. Very unpleasant stay and unsafe. Will not stay there ever again."
"Had a terrible stay. I've stayed in many extended stays across the country and this one has shamed the brand. This hotel smelled, it was unclean, dark and cramped. The rooms were dated,my mattress didn't even have a fitted sheet I saw how nasty and disgusting the conditions of the mattresses. We didn't have any toilet paper in our room upon arrival.the room was less than mediocre. Towels were dingy and worn out. Fire detector was hanging on by a wire literally about to fall off the ceiling. hotel was in bad condition, was more like a motel. Will never stay here again. next time I'll pay more money to stay in a better hotel."
"I had a pleasant stay here while I was visiting family for Thanksgiving. The front desk service is what won me over more than the room. I think her same was Sheree, was absolutely the most helpful. She pointed me in the direction of great night spots and wonderful restaurants. Thanks to her I almost forgot about Thanksgiving food!"
"Just really good people. A very clean hotel. An excellent location. An acceptable breakfast. My family enjoyed it. The staff was friendly and kind and responsive. Check in and check out were without problems and extremely simple."
"We stayed here last Friday before July 4th to see a show at 1st Avenue. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are great. Their beds are very comfortable and the location you can't beat. Whether you're going to a Twins game or going to see a show around the downtown area it's a great place to stay. The... More"
"We had a family reunion and everyone had a great time. The lobby had a lot of room with comfortable seating to hang out as a large group. An attached parking garage and 3 block walk to the light rail, plus many restaurants pubs within walking distance made for an easy home base for our young to old group."
"This is a great Hampton. The lobby is huge, and there's more than enough room to spread out for breakfast. My corner room was terrific, looking right out on the legendary theater, First Avenue and 7th St. Entry. I had reserved a King, and there was a couch, desk and plenty of floor room to pace around (something I never... More"
"Certainly not a 5 star, but a GREAT value for the Price. Friendly Staff and Comfortable room. No extras but the Bed is comfortable and the Room is Clean. Great Weekly Rate and Pet Friendly. Not a Single Complaint."
"Looking for a place to stay while in the Oklahoma City area---you couldn't do much more in Moore than to choose the Best Western motel Plus. It is in the middle between OKC Norman and in the midst of most name brand eateries. The staff was very friendly Helpful most helpful."
"Personnel during our weekend were just great, esp. Ashley Front Desk offering suggestions and answering every single question. NOW! it is difficult to navigate with two towers but, once you get the zoop that the 3rd floor is the skyway - OK / plus, the parking garage is not an EZ lay-out and the schlep to the lobby on...

"Right in the heart of Down town and close to everything you need. One of the best hotels in the city and the prices were pretty reasonable too. I stayed here for my Honeymoon several years ago and it was such a fantastic place. We ate at the restraint on the top floor and the food was fantastic and the... More"
"No need to look anywhere else when staying in Louisville! For the price, proximity to YUM Center and the beautiful views of the river, it's the best deal going! Cafe Magnolia (2nd floor) is a great casual restaurant. Thelma's Deli is perfect for fruit, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast biscuits, etc."
"2nd time to stay at the Galt House. My son's archery team stayed there during the NASP tournament. Great facility and staff was wonderful. Rooms were great, and group price made it affordable. Food at Cafe Magnolia was excellent."
"I love visiting the Galt House because the customer service is fantastic rooms are always super clean. The suites tower is my favorite part of the hotel. The breakfast is phenomenal (especially the pancakes ordered from room service). Definitely plan on a relaxing stay at the Galt House."
"Very clean, good service, nice amenities, beautiful decor. I've stayed here twice for conferences and will go back if I have a chance. Incredible suites! No complaints! And the downtown Louisville area has some great food fairly close to the hotel."
"Valet is best parking choice. 3rd floor bridge has indoor bridge between 2 towers Retail Row has regional inventory. Great place to stay for large event hosted here. Plus it's within walking distance of many local attractions on Museum Row trendy restaurants."
"The stay at this hotel was amazing. The suites were a great value and the beds were like sleeping on clouds and floating. I loved the pillows and they have Bath and Body work soap and lotion. It was a very nice hotel for a very good price!"
"Mold in the first three rooms they showed me. Not until they sent me to the top floor in the fourth room did I find a room that didn't smell of mold. Good service willing to help, and very attentive, but they need to fix the mold in their rooms."
"The hotel was a nightmare . I killed big roaches, bathroom was falling apart. First floor I saw baby roaches all over the microwave . Elevator was broke so we had to walk up to second and third for two days and was broke when we left. Food that ordered or sitting in the lounge stayed there to the next... More"

"Our family stayed in this Holiday Inn and Suites last weekend. We had side by side rooms but was a little disappointed that they don't have adjoining doors for the rooms. We had children with us and it would have been nice to have a way for them to go from room to room without having to go in the... More"
"The carpet was so dirty that we had to where socks and still clean our feet. The Sheets for the bed felt like sandpaper and the shower never gave hot water. Cannot recommend staying here to anyone."
"Rats running around the parking lot. My husband and I saw FIVE rats running around the parking lot and one jumped out a trash can. I don't do rats I am always been afriad of rats and I wasnt expacting that. I didn't feel comfortable staying there. Management was'nt helpful at all. I was there for my son's graduation from the Navy he had completed boot camp. So this was an important visit. We had to find another hotel at night and I had to pay more money.No one was helpful to us at all."
"Dirty hotel with questionable people living in the hotel."
"For our wedding we rented the king balcony suite. The room was spacious and perfect for getting ready. The large bathroom, bedroom, and living room allowed for multiple people to get ready and for my wife and I to not see each other as we were both getting ready. The bar had excellent cocktails and the in-room coffee was good... More"
"Our one night stay at the Modern was the perfect complement to our introduction to Boise. Hip and retro-modern rooms were beautiful and comfortable (the bed!) and spotless. It's clear a lot of thought was put into curating the guest room experience from the exclusive indie film experience available on the room tv to the door tags. AND we needed... More"
"Makeover was done well and not over the top. Dinner was good. Had the risotto. The chef has a mushroom obsession, so be forewarned. Breakfast was outstanding. Healthy and tasty choices and a warm, cheery staff. Personally, I would have preferred a firmer mattress, but still slept very well."
"This hotel is GREAT! Not only does it have a great vibe, but it's very clean and the restaurant is wonderful! The rooms are updated nicely and the rain head shower is great! I will stay here again for sure."
"The Modern is a great place to stay in Boise, especially for someone who values the small and personal. It's walking distance to downtown and a mere stroll to a great brewery and a few taprooms. The fantastic Big City Coffee is practically next door and it has it's own bar that offers some amazing drinks. A lovely place to... More"
"This is the second time that I stayed at this hotel. The rooms have been remodeled and are very modern. Showers are exceptional with good cable TV. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Very short drive from the airport and located very close to the downtown action."
"Great new and clean hotel. Staff is friendly and location is perfect. The only negative is the valet charge of 32/day. I thought that was excessive. I am not sure what the self park cost is since I arrived after midnight and just wanted to go to sleep once I got there."
"Stayed here for about four days while in town visiting family. We had a two year old with us, and the check in staff offered him a snack from the gift shop upon check in. They were so accommodating when we requested early check in as well. Our two bedroom suite was very clean and comfortable, and had plenty of... More"

Most definitely a people person and seems to love what he does. Ensuring the guest is comfortable"
"SUPER NICE HOTEL!! Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now."

"I checked in very late and was informed by the very nice guest services rep that they had oversold the hotel for the evening.

"Hi Folks, My wife and I have been loyal Platinum Card Best Western customers for years. We get a clean, comfortable, quiet room (I sound like Tom Baudette) and a buffet breakfast in most of the chain. It also has business services when you need them. Who could ask for more in a mid-priced motel. Regards, OldeBear"

The beds were comfy and the room was clean. The restaurant downstairs gave hubby and I free Shirley temples! I loved it and wished I could have stayed longer to fully take advantage of the amenities. I will definitely be back!!!!"
"Location, facilty, everything is OK. Free coffee and snacks, meal (maybe breakfast only) was nice, you can even keep it to your room. There is no front desk in the hotel, but if you have something to ask, the doorman takes care of most of them, just ask them. Instead, there are large desks in the lobby with power supply... More"

"Short walk to conference at Minute Made Park, hotel being renovated and I was in a new room that was small but perfect for my needs with a Queen bed, desk and swivel chair, comfortable arm chair, good size shower in adequate size bathroom. Only thing missing was a shelf or stand for my suitcase. A lot of construction in the neighborhood but I heard nothing."
"We picked this hotel for price and location - it's a quick drive to the MFAH and walking distance from the George Brown Convention Center. We had a number of restaurants (mostly chains) and bars within walking distance to choose from. The hotel itself was exactly what we wanted - clean and well staffed. We'd happily stay there again."
"The people as we arrived were very courteous and helpful with our luggage, check in was easy, took us to our room and made sure everything was ok with us. We used the shuttle service to go to the ball park, Oscar, was great in getting us there.

"I was trying to save money when I booked a room here for three nights. The only good thing I can say is it was inexpensive. The bathroom sink was literally falling off the wall.

By the time she left, we had a really great of idea of what we wanted for our wedding invitations. Her... Read More relationships with multiple stationers allowed us to get our Letterpress invitations for almost a third of what we were quoted at other stationary vendors. Once the proof review started, Kristen was on our side as we had to work through a few design issues with our vendor. Kristen made sure we got exactly what we wanted despite having to go through four revisions to get the design just right. Our invitations turned out perfectly. We were getting emails and texts after they all went out saying they were the most original and prettiest invitations they had ever received. Thanks Silver Starfish for setting the stage for the rest of our wedding."

"Stayed at two different hotels in seattle. The maxwell is a gret location for the space needle, seattle center, science center, sculpture garden, etc. another huge benefit was the free parking- which is rare in seattle. The room came with many nice complimentary ammenities- kuerig coffee, popcorn, tea, shuttle rides, etc. For the price- this place was unbeatable."
"Located directly next to the Space Needle and with all kinds of food options nearby, the Maxwell served as an excellent base for discovering Seatlle.

Although breakfast isn't complimentary we can recommend the coffee and freshly toasted bagels from the espresso bar."

"Check-in was easy. Parked in the free parking, which is a rarity in Seattle.

The desk staff is very friendly and very helpful on things to do and places to eat. The housekeeping staff and handy man... More"
"The sea captain has it all, it is the friendliest place I have ever had the good fortune to visit. My self and my family will be returning for the third year in a row this September. The staff are exceptional and cannot be any more welcoming than they are. You truly feel like part of a family. Along with... More"
"My son and I recently spent two nights at this hotel and really enjoyed it. The only downsides are that a larger hotel was built right next door and it hides the building and that it will be torn down in about a year to build a bigger hotel. That's a shame because this place has history. Our room was... More"
"Room is disrepair, rude manager, average breakfast. Possible mold on the wallpaper! I which some was falling off. Plus I've never seen anyone put drywall over wallpaper. At least the breakfast lady was friendly and it was quiet. Do they buy their reviews"
"Very dubious about our stay here as had read very mixed reviews. The hotel is situated in a commercial/industrial area, so is very quiet in the evenings. The subway is a 2 min walk away and there a dew convenience stores close-by, includung a delicious chinese bakery. The hotel was very clean and welcoming. all staff were helpful. They printed... More"
"Virtually the only place for any regular live music and good entertainment in town or to have interesting, intelligent conversation with the awesome staff. A very lively and intimate bar."
"I stayed last year and room was great. This year - complete opposite. The mattress was bad, the sofa was stain with who knows what!!! It was just a filthy disappointment - as I highly recommended this hotel based on my experience the prior year. I WILL NOT RETURN to this hotel. However, the staff at the front desk was friendly - the only good thing about this stay!!"
"Hotel was clean and staff very helpful, friendly, and professional. I think the room and price comparing with other hotels were very reasonable. It is in a good area. I would recommend this hotel to others."
"I have never been treated more like an honored guest than during my recent stay. The property is fine but the staff is exceptional. Mail deliveries, lost keys local hints, all were managed very well, The weekend manager in particular is full of good local knowledge."
"I needed a place to stay for the night and I chose this hotel. I'm not picky since I am prior military, so the room was clean and bed was comfortable. I would stay here again."
"The toilet had not been flushed. The woman at the front desk did want to reimburse me some of my money, but said she had to call Hotels.com to do that."
"You cannot beat this hotel for the price and location in Allentown. It also allows dogs which for me is fantastic. The rooms have always been spotless and the staff is always friendly. Although this time I had a minor problem with the rate, the manager corrected the problem immediately when he was made aware of the problem. You can... More"
"For some reason according to the front desk the regular queen room booked from Hotels.com gave us a handicap room. I stayed at a wonderful Red Roof Inn in Boston a few years ago. Since then i have been to 2 in Pennsylvania. It is definitely not the same. Won't be staying at red roof again"
"great hotel within walking distance of Clinton Library and the capitol and all many places to eat and the service was great, just be aware parking is shared with a condo ,but plenty of parking and its 7 dollars a night extra but cheaper then anywhere in any other downtown city in USA"
"This recently remodeled facility looked, smelled and felt clean and fresh - very modern. The secure parking was easily accessible and security within the hotel itself was excellent. Bed was comfortable, wi-fi was good, and staff was very friendly and accommodating. Would definitely stay here again."
"Located in downtown Little Rock, I found myself only steps away from restaurants and other activities offered by this city. For frequent travelers, it's on par with what you would expect from the Hampton brand, added with some very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely my pick in Little Rock in the future."
"What a wonderful hotel. My sister and I arrived late in the day so the hotel tried to connect with us via phone and email in advance of our arrival to confirm and ensure we had an easy arrival, even though we were arriving after the front desk was closed for the day. They left us all the details we... More"
"The accommodations were lovely and the view was spectacular. You can go to the 2nd floor and view the personal planes take off. We weren't able to go to their dinner since they are closed on Mondays. 8 min away from downtownThank you for choosing The Hangar Hotel for your anniversary! We hope it was the best one yet. We appreciate you taking the time to post your review. Come back and visit us soon!"
"Excellent customer service, we were able to check in 2 hours early! Friendly staff, cookies and coffee upon arrival, valet parking. Great location!"
"The hotel is at the best location, convenient for shopping, hiking, or simply relaxing. The breakfast (included) is incredibly good and generous. Free village parking and transportation are just a few steps away. Overall, a great deal."
"WONDERFUL!!! IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT ANOTHER PLACE IN VAIL- STOP LOOKING AND BOOK THIS. Location is great!! Rooms are wonderful and clean and bedding is oh so great Top notch service"
"The hotel lobby is quaint, but the room was well appointed. The room slept well and the internet connections was great. The property is in a great locations, closely located near the slopes and the amphitheater. There was a welcome reception that was very nice, with complimentary wine and hors d'oeuvres. This was a lovely trip, I hope to visit... More"
"We stayed here for a friends wedding and fell in Love. The hotel is right on one of the main pedestrian roads and within minutes of all the glory that Vail has to offer. The room was cute, super fluffy and comfortable bed. Tiny windows which made the room a bit dark, but not a big deal. The bathroom was... More"
"Everything was great... Location, room, pool, staff... Highly recommended"
"Great location in Vail. Located right along the river. Nice heated pool and hot tub. Great customer service."
"Recently, enjoyed with my family and grandchildren 3 nights at this quaint beautiful centrally located hotel. Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity. Walk literally out the door and you are welcomed by the abundance of shopping and restaurants. We will most certainly book this hotel again."
"We stayed at this hotel during the weekend of our daughter's wedding. It was a convenient location to New Albany Links. The room clean and spacious. Hotel staff were very accommodating. And the shuttle to and from the wedding venue was awesome!"
"My friend's family reserved a section of rooms for their daughter's wedding. The hotel personnel were very helpful and friendly. Our rooms were used for preparing for the wedding, and the hotel was accommodating, from ensuring that room supplies were ample to helping us navigate around town. This hotel was clean and hospitable!!!"
"My stay here was excellent!! Clean rooms great staff. The best part of my stay was Cynthia. She is such a go get her. She will help you with anything you need. Made me feel right at home. That's the kind of service I expect when I stay at any hotel. Thanks again."

"Flying into Ft. Lauderdale airport in the evening, I wanted a hotel nearby on the beach. This resort is less than 10 miles from the airport, and a very short block from the beach. To find the hotel, you need to turn into Hayes Street, then turn left on the alley to find parking on Garfield Street, which is a... More"

"We booked at Grand prix Motel last minute for Jeep week 2016. I was a little skeptical due to the stories you hear about outdated motels and the few bad reviews. This is my first time ever doing a review but I felt like this place deserved it. Very well maintained family owned motel with private balcony right on Daytona... More"
"only stayed for one night so it suited our purpose which was to hang out at the pool and the beach and not in a motel room.....the pool was clean and right on the beach. the room was clean and well maintained....great customer service. also had no problems with parking. we will definitely be back!"
"The hotel and staff were great! There is a lot of construction in the area, so that made it hard to see the hotel as well as arriving/leaving due to traffic."
"I was very disappointed with my stay . I was charged 270.00 dollars to my credit card for so called damage. I call to see what they were talking about and ask for pictures to be sent to my e mail .and ask to speak to Manger. Got the run around got hung up on after trying to see what they were talk about . Because room was left very clean . We only took a shower and slept we didn't even use anything else in are room. All towels were left in bathroom in a pile after we used them bed was clean . Are room was left in tact . They haven't refund my money back and has not show me what so called damages. So be aware of their scam !"
"Really nice hotel, clean, big room and less the 8 min from the airport"
"Great motel, especially if you want to be close to downtown and the MAX. Clean rooms, really helpful staff who know Portland, and excellent location."
"This had to be the worst Crown Plaza I have ever stayed. I stayed 2 nights to attend a wedding and I didn't sleep at all. Aside from the tired/boring decor, the room had a supposed queen bed that really should be classified as full size with a mattress harder than a sidewalk and pillows flatter than a short stack... More"
"Stayed at this hotel for a couple of weeks travelling on business. An excellent business hotel, rooms are spacious and well maintained. Wifi works like a charm. Breakfast is sumptuous. Pickup is provided by hotel from the nearest bus stop."
"I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Nashua while visiting family in the area this past week-end I had a wonderful stay from beginning to the end. The hotel was extremely busy with wedding guests and events, yet the front desk staff were extremely professional and welcomed us upon arrival. We our room was a suite which was exceptionally clean and... More"
"The minute you step into the room at the Crowne Plaza Nashua, you can see that the they haven't been redone in decades. The wallpaper is even peeling off in the bathrooms. This kind of neglect can be forgiven if the room itself is comfortable. Unfortunately that was not the case. The bed in our room was one of the... More"
"My family attended the Easter Brunch at the Crowne Plaza on March 27, 2016. We were a large party of 11 including 4 children. The food was fantastic. There was a great variety of breakfast and lunch foods, salads a variety of pastries and rolls and tons of desert items. My nephew hit the custom made to order omelet station... More"
"I stayed at The Maritime Hotel on May 21-22, 2016. It is a stylishly appointed space throughout, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful both check in and check out were a breeze. They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay."
"Loved the hotel, perfect location for shopping at Chelsea Market and walking the Highline. I plan to stay here again soon!"
"Needed a hotel near the West Village and with parking -- this was perfect. Hotel is very chic, and room was comfortable with lots of storage which offset its small size. Will definitely be using this hotel again in the future."
"Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!"
"Our visit to Bricktown was wonderful. From the time we arrived at the hotel and throughout our visit everyone was extraordinarily welcoming. They really made us feel they were glad we were there. Location of the hotel is perfect to experience the excitement of the Riverwalk. This is definitely a place we will visit again."
"We got to check in early! This is a perfect location for Bricktown entertainment and great food! Clean room and friendly staff! There is piano bar across the street and great places to eat within walking distance!Dear Susan G, So happy that your experience was perfect!!! We hope to see you again soon!! Thank you for the review!! Sincerely, Carolyn Temple"
"Stayed 2 nights here for business. My room looked out over the ballpark where the OKC Dodgers (Pacific Coast League AAA Club plays). Beautiful setting in Bricktown. Situated downtown, restaurants are nearby walking distance. The rooms are well-appointed, quiet and beds very comfortable. The breakfast setup is varied and has something for everyone (who eats). Nice property. The parking lot... More"
"I arrived at the Hilton Garden Inn (HGI) Oklahoma City - Bricktown with the expectations that all HGI's are roughly the same. This location proved me wrong. The front desk staff speedily provided our rooms, parking, and dining provisions. My room, while nothing out of the ordinary, seemed just a little extra clean and organized than most hotels. For the... More"
"This hotel offers clean rooms, great service and is within walking distance of everything in Bricktown. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Parking is a little tricky when trying to locate the elevators. Otherwise, it was a nice hotel. Would definitely recommend!"
"We stayed as a layover, booked it a few hours before we arrived. Staff was phenominal! Hotel was clean and pretty, food was wonderful. Walked to bricktown for dinner, watched a baseball game out our window in the stadium to the south. Great stay!"
"We were initially going to break our drive up into two days, but felt OK after 6 hours of driving , so we continued. En route, we called our hotel (we had reservations over 2 months) asked if we would be able to check-in a day early, and we did so with no problem. We opted not to use... More"

"Beautiful hotel and very friendly and helpful staff. The view was amazing because hotel is on the river."
"I loved my room, which had the same footprint as the A Loft I'd visited in Miami. Not a surprise--they're both Starwood properties. Comfortable and well-appointed with a kitchenette that had anything I might want or need during a business trip. Happy hour in the lobby as well as a light morning breakfast are also friendly and casual. The workout... More"
"Staff all helpful and welcoming. Room very comfortable with great views of the Rockies. Breakfast was nice and easy to take to work. Great pool and gym and outdoor fire pit area. Will definitely stay again."
"Stayed two nights with two girlfriends in a room with 2 queen beds. Elkey on the front desk was very friendly on our arrival, and even sent a bottle of cava to our room to celebrate my friends' birthdays! Bellman (Argentinian, as I recall) was very helpful with directions and suggestions. Our room met our needs perfectly! Beds sooo comfy... More"
"Very horrible customer service at the beginning of our stay and during our stay, We are.very disappointed with this hotel. The walls are paper thin. The customer service rep hung up on me as I was describing how loud the guest was next door."
"A group of people from our Church get together for lunch/brunch once a month after morning worship. We love to come to Spoonbread but our December get-together is always a highlight. They set up tables for us near the Christmas tree in the lobby. The wide variety of food choices including the omelet bar are enjoyed by all. The staff... More"
"I just spent 7 days in the Westin Poinsett and enjoy the time from arrival to departure. This was my second time in Greenville with Trek Travel. It's is the perfect venue for cycling.

"My trips to Greenville (2 to 3 times a year) are usually at least a week long and I would not choose to stay anywhere else, although I've had to because getting a room at certain times of the year is difficult.

Matt Konrad the A/V manager made... More"

"We always love staying at this hotel. The rooms are very comfy and it is conveniently located downtown in the vicinity of great local restaurants. The only downside to our last two visits has been not being able to take advantage of the Make Sunday's Better late check-out. If this hotel cannot accommodate late Sunday checkouts then that should be... More"
"My first visit in 2016 and the Westin's staff continues to provide excellent service. They are genuinely willing to accommodate a guest's request. I enjoy my visits to Greenville but along with a wonderful downtown, great restaurants, beautiful Reedy river it's made complete by returning to the Pointsett to relax and enjoy the down time."
"The Westin Poinsett Hotel is a beautifully restored gem with a long history of delivering southern hospitality at its best.

"We did an on-line reservation and thought we had reserved a 2 queen room - ends up it was a king room. No problem - changed us over to a 2 queen room like it was no big deal. The young woman at the front really knew her job and was so customer service friendly. Also the young woman helping... More"

"This is a very nice place. Rooms were decorated nicely, roomy, and cool! I loved the seating area by the pool, but it does get a bit loud with all of the kids. Would have like an outdoor seating area away from the pool/kids. Wifi was fast, breakfast was good, and there were lots of green spaces for our dogs.... More"
"We were impressed by how pet-friendly Oxford Suites was! We had just adopted a 6yo chocolate lab from Lab Rescue of Fresno, and the hotel welcomed him (and us) with open paws! They also provided a great doggy bag filled with bottles of water, dog treats, doggy scoop bags, and even a collapsible dog bowl! Our room was clean and comfortable, at a reasonable price. And the breakfast was excellent! Thank you Oxford Suites!"
"Great place to stay. Rooms were very nice, bed extremely comfortable. the breakfast and evening reception was a pleasant surprise. But most of all I want to talk about the customer service!

"We came to Redding to handle a family tragedy when my wife passed away. The staff was very friendly and even recognized is from a visit 6 months previously ( it was one of the last visits my children had with their mom). The fact that we were recognized and welcomed back brought back memories of a happier time and gave us a brief respite from the reality we were experiencing. Thank you so much."
"We (two families, group of 4 adults and 4 kids) showed up at the hotel at 9pm, we were told that there was only one room booked under my name. I was also told that may be there was an error in transcribing the online order to paper. The receptionist was kind and she took responsibility for the mistake on... More"
"I'd never heard of the Oxford Suites, so wasn't sure what to expect. Wow, what a pleasant surprise! Don't let the price (approx 100 per night ) scare you away. Sure you can hunt for a lower priced hotel in Redding for 70-80 a night- BUT I sincerely doubt they'll have the services and extras that the Oxford offers! Beautiful,... More"

"When I booked this room, I knew there was a separate living area, but had no idea of the real size of the place. It was huge for a hotel room. There is a little kitchenette and dining area with nice appliances and a great set up. Then there the living area, that could be converted into another sleeping area.... More"
"Over priced, old, and gross. We arrived in our very small room to towels that someone with a bad cold blew their nose in. Yes, that was left for us. The front desk laughed when they saw it. Maybe they laughed because they had to come back in from smoking to help. The bathrooms are similar to what you'd find... More"

"Overall the Viceroy was a really nice hotel. When I first arrived, I was disappointed that the hotel wasn't on the ocean, instead it was one block back. However, the staff made an initial impression when I entered. Very professional, courteous and attentive. The room itself was a little small, but very nicely decorated and immaculate. To me, the highlight... More"

"After a weeks tour from San Francisco driving then all the way down the coast this was the perfect resting place for our final week.

The staff are extremely friendly and helpful -- truly the best hotel I have stayed at in a long time."
"Really enjoyed our stay at this property! The standard rooms are fairly decent sized and so are he bathrooms. The lounge area is spectacular and vey lively at night. The biggest advantage of this hotel is the location. It's close to the 3rd street promenade and the pier the beach at Santa Monica.. Will visit again!!"
"We decided to try Viceroy Santa Monica after staying at Viceroy Abu Dhabi and enjoying it so much. The hotel is set a street or two back from the beach which was fine but we had an ocean view room which made up for it. There may be some traffic noise if you're staying on the lower floors but we...

"Not particularly clean. Bathrooms very small with small toilets. Front desk clerk very polite. no elevators. Breakfast was decent. No elevators. Repairs needed."
"This room should have been advertised for 19. I can't believe I spent 80 on this place! For starters, the sheets looked unclean, and when we pulled the blankets back the pillows beneath were -covered- in an assortment of straight and curly black hairs. I'm sure they haven't been laundered for centuries. There were moth wings melted into the insides... More"
"I was not impressed with this motel when I stayed there - the breakfast was very mediocre and the toilet didn't want to flush. But it was afterward that I was really appalled by the poor customer service. I know it is my responsibility to keep track of my belongings but sometimes something gets left behind. I left a pair... More"
"The staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoy the room layout because of the extra living space to hang out in. We also love the Reese's cookies as an evening treat! They are so yummy warmed up."
"Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure."

I am employed in the housekeeping field so my standards in cleanliness and neatness go way beyond and my room was neat clean and very nice. I enjoyed the breakfast the hotel offered in the morning.

"Having traveled more than 42 states and therefore... many hotels over the years including even having a 'Business Class' in BC's renowned Empress Hotel years back... And I can attest to the fact that I never felt more cared about and never have received such personable and excellent TLC anywhere - Ever! They have a staff that is extraordinary in... More"
"We stayed here for one night at the end of May. It was a last minute find and we got a great room, very clean, stylish. Amenities were great. Free wifi. Close to town. We would definitely return if we end up in Ojai again."
"Used this hotel for an overnight before a cruise. It was very welcoming, the shuttle to the hotel from FLL was easy to contact and meet up with and a gas station next door was useful for grabbing a quick something. ( the nearby McDonald's is a whole other story). Nothing else nearby but for a stop over it worked... More"
"I took my son and daughter to Miami Sunny Isles Beach for the Surfers Healing event. This was our very first time in Miami. Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area."
"Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too. Good thing the air conditioner was good and loud it blocked the street noise. Stayed at few holiday Inn express and they've been decent. Not so much here and they charge more rooms at the big H.I. Overall impression...not impressed."
"We were just staying overnight en route to the Bahamas. When we arrived at nearly 1 am, we discovered that our reservation did not exist, our travel provider had instead booked us into a hotel in Baltimore in April. Luckily for us, night auditor Dalia came to our rescue. She worked non-stop for an hour, speaking to the call centre,... More"
"Came to visit Miami with friends relatively last minute. Flew in FLL. Very packed weekend w/ the Ultra Music fest Spring Break going on. Stayed in Hollywood for a recent visit in 2015 (Comfort Suites one exit back) so I did not mind the commute to Miami, especially cause I have a rental car. This hotel was very convenient...right...

"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service."
"loved it here will go again"
"Keep driving! The other family that we were traveling with booked and paid for this room far in advance. We arrived without the other family and was given a room on the second level. When my husband and I exited the elevator with our luggage the entire length of the hall smelled like a skunk had run down it. It... More"
"This was a super place for our convention needs. The room was clean, efficient, and allowed for green savings (5.00 coupon per day when maid service for towels and sheets weren't laundered We redeemed the daily coupons at the XYZ Bar in the lobby!). Loved the room layout which allowed for a long bench between desks for our double bed... More"
"Very very good location. This hotel is literally across the street from the Tennessee aquarium. We easily walked to dinner from the hotel, then also walked later in the evening to the movie theater a block over. While we didn't shop, it appeared that there was shopping nearby for those who want to. Very nice accommodations. Comfy bed, hot shower,... More"
"The Hampton Inn exceeded all our expectations. We were traveling to visit family with our daughter and her family. Traveling with little ones can be stressful, but the staff here were very pleasant and accommodating to our needs. I will definitely stay here for our next visit."
"I was traveling in February 2015, was tired and stopped at this terrible place. The front desk lady was very kind and quite understanding when I requested my money back. The room was full of roaches, E V E R Y W H E R E! Left running, kept driving."
"I would like to recognize Johnny's patience, professionalism, hospitality and assistance through out my stay here at the Hampton Inn. Given that I myself am in the hospitality industry, I am not easy to please... however, Johnny has been amazing! Thank you! Housekeeping does an excellent job at this hotel.

"Rent from SIXT for lowest rates then taxi 5 mins. ride to hotel. Hotel shuttle is very on time for pick up delivery at terminal. Meals at Hilton short walk is good selections. Pool is nice. Breakfast is best I have encountered."
"I had no complaints and would stay again. I have stayed at several different Hampton Inns and this was as nice as any others I've I stayed. The staff was friendly, the room was nice and clean, and breakfast, although the typical Hampton fare, was great."
"This motel was close to the airport and only a short drive from a shopping mall and many fine restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The whole facility was very well kept and having cold, fruit flavored water available in the lobby was very refreshing in hot July. We would certainly stay here again."
"Very nice hotel with lots of character. Would like frig and microwave in room. Other than that the hotel is great."
"This hotel superseded my expections. Rooms were gorgeous and hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating! Great location that I could walk to everything!"
"The staff could not have done more to make our stay in Charleston so pleasant. Can't wait to return and see the renovated lobby. Perfect location for exploring!"
"We had an incredible time in Charleston and the Mills House was great."
"Pricey, but that may have had more to do with the Spilleto festival that was going on while we were there. Excellent service and great location... Would definitely stay again if I return."
"Our room was really comfortable and cozy. The hotel is in the middle of the historic downtown, close to the Old Slave Mart Museum, Waterfront Park, St. Michael Church etc. Good restaurant in the hotel or across the street."
"Sehr schnes Hotel in romantischem Sdstaatenflair. Ausgezeichnetes Preis-Leistungsverhltnis. Sehr zentrale Lage. Alles problemlos zu Fuss erreichbar."
"Loved the hotel. Rooms adequate sized and clean and well appointed. Staff courteous, friendly and capable, and public areas beautiful."
"We had a family reunion of 14 and everything worked out superbly. The hotel is well located, very clean and the staff could not be more pleasant.We loved it."
"I've stayed in this hotel many times, and it's always a good experience. The rooms have recently been renovated, making this an even nicer place to stay. The location is great...within walking distance to so much in Charleston."
"Loved the location - was able to walk to everything in the historical area.  Hotel was very well maintained.  Staff was friendly.  Had some issues with valet but other than that, loved the hotel."
"I was extremely happy with the location of the hotel, it is located in the heart of historic Charleston with everything within walking distance. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and the decor was charming."
"The stay was great! Only complaint (not really) was we were too close to King Street where my wife spent a lot of money. Location was very convenient to all the sights and restaurants we targeted. Hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the best way to arrange our trip to Ft. Sumter."
"We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days. We needed the car once and it was brought to us in a timely manner. The staff was courteous and helpful. We were spoiled by everyone. Looking forward to staying at the Mills House again."
"This hotel was in a terrific location.  Walking distance from all sights.  The hotel staff was very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning and they had a room for us.  Our flight out was late in the day, so they held our luggage and also called for our cab service to the airport, which arrived right on schedule."
"This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel."
"Phantastic location in Charleston Historic District. The hotel comes along with \"Sothern Comfort\" and a historic 18th Century flair mixed with modern amenities. Shoping and dining locations are a few yards around the corner in King Street and Market Street. Charlestons historic houses start right across the street going south on Meeting Street. Definitely a great destination to stay at for a Charleston visit!!!"
"Me and my 13 yr. old daughter loved the hotel. The staff was great and very freindly.... the were not totally booked and they gave us a cool room overlooking the pool. They also allowed us a later than usual checkout... never know until you ask. We also enjoyed the cute workout room and the excellent breakfast buffet.Thanks Mills House for making my daughters spring break a success!!!"
"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen."
"Just stayed at The Mills House with 3 girlfriends, it was wonderful. It is a beautiful hotel and close to the historic district. Didn't want to leave! Couldn't have been more perfect."
"The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit."
"The Mills House is in a great location in the heart of Charleston's Historic District. There is a parking garage next door w/a walkway leading right to the Mills House. Once we parked the car, we had no need to move it - everything is w/i walking distance. There are several good restaurants also w/i walking distance of The Mills House.We are very pleased w/the accessibility of Hotels.com, the easy and prompt confirmation, and knowing there is someone at hand should we need them.Thank You!"
"Our hotel room was very comfortably decorated and cozy, with everything we needed. The views were great and the bathroom well appointed. The hotel bar was very classically decorated and comfortable. W thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
"My husband and I have been to Charleston multiple times and stayed at a lot of different places in the \"Historic Downtown\". This is out favorite! The staff is amazing! The valet guys actually went to my vehicle to pump up my little girls floaties (I have a tire/air pump to plug into my car). Then they delivered the floaties to the pool!The hotel was also clean and so convenient to everything!"
"everything was great - location, hotel lobby,  pool, The  only negative point was the awful coffee served at breakfast. Breakfast food in and off itself was fine. Loved being able to sit on the patio"
"The Mills is located with in walking distance of all of the historic district . My wife and I really enjoyed being able to walk to our dinner dates and see the sites all around us. Thanks do much!"
"We close on our house downtown, and needed a place to stay after the move. I really didn't have that much time at the hotel,because I was in late, and out early. My wife had more time, and really enjoyed it. I wish they served coffee before 6:30"
"Great loqcation, price. The beds were a bit small, we prefer queen beds instead of double"
"Only stayed one night but would have loved to stay more. Great location, everything was within easy walking distance. Beautiful hotel and wonderfully nice and helpful staff. No complaints."
"Nice room overlooking the street and the river. Wonderful breakfasts as well."
"We skiied at nearby Cascade Mountain and stayed at this inn. The breakfast included waffles, hard boiled eggs, muffins, bagels, cereal, apples and plenty of good coffee. The beds were fine with extra pillows, the room had a flat screen TV and was quiet. The pool was medium size and the hot tub was fine. Good hotel."
"We loved the hotel and the staff. The concierges were especially helpful. It is in the best location for sightseeing and restaurants. One criticism - when I booked with your service, you told me a carriage ride and walking tour were included. The hotel staff said they never have included those extras. Hotels.com needs to straighten that out."
"We found the room very clean, the hotel staff was friendly, the breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. The only thing I'd do different next time is self-park. We used the valet parking, which was wonderful, but we didn't need the car during our stay because everything was so close. We could have saved some money by using the parking deck located behind the hotel."
"Great location for city tours. Comfortable room. LOVE the courtyard for a nice drink after walking all day. Good breakfast buffet."
"My husband and I took my mother to Charleston for three days over Christmas. Mills House was beautifully decorated, perfectly located and staffed by the most helpful people! We were able to walk everywhere and were just across Queen from several fine restaurants. We will be back"
"We could not have had a better stay at the Mills House Hotel. Every detail was managed well. Because of our recent bookings at other hotels in this chain, we were automatically upgraded to their priority club. Great amenities came with the upgrade, which made our stay more enjoyable. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The front desk and concierge made dinner suggestions and reservations for us both nights, with which we were very satisfied. We could not have stayed in a better hotel. We will stay there again if we return."
"Have stayed at quite a few of the Hyatt House/Place brand hotels. EAch has a nice sized room, divided up, make it very convenient if sleeping schedules are the same. Nice TV, everything was in the room as needed. A great stay!"
"When I made this reservation I asked for a low floor because my daughter has a lot of sezuires and we needed to be able to get out quick if need be. The room was huge and very clean and the staff is very friendly. Will definatly be back. Thank you for acomidating us."
"We were just there for one night en route from Ohio to Massachusetts, but the hospitality of the staff after 14 hours on the road was much appreciated. The room was exceptionally clean (I normally am skeeved out by even the moderately clean hotels and felt comfortable here) and there's a full bar and multiple types of actually GOOD food... More"
"I have been coming to this hotel for 5 years now. There are several other places in the area, but I come here. The staff is the main reason I keep coming back. Lindsay Sweeney in particular has been quite the hostess and expert on local food and fun. She has sent me to several wonderful restaurants and helped me... More"
"This is a really wonderful hotel! We booked two rooms for our stay. We were there at 3pm and we were able to check into only one of them because the other wasn't finished being cleaned. They were going to call us when the other room was ready. We waited around for about an hour and we finally went back in and asked. We reserved a room with a balcony- well, they didn't have one. Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much! This place is really kept up and clean!! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you for such an awesome trip!!"
"All was wonderful, courteous staff, good choice of breakfast items, clean and quiet. Was surprised that the room thermostat would not respond to my setting, it was programmed to a pre-set temp which was a little too warm for my liking."
"The night front desk attendant Debbie was rude and unprofessional. She made sarcastic remarks such as I wish you could count in response to me asking for a certain number of towels. I awaited a call from the Front Desk Manager Gary Gillette all day on 2/29/16 he didn't call I had to call the hotel. He didn't care much... More"
"This hotel is the best we have stayed at in Baton Rouge -- Large rooms, very nice kitchen with granite and stainless appliances, clean bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries, very comfortable bed with high quality bedding. The breakfast room was lovely with several choices for the hot breakfast, and the lobby was beautiful and inviting -- fireplace, comfortable leather furniture, fresh flower arrangements. Everything was nice, including the landscaping. We were impressed."
"Great hotel. We will be spending New Years Eve there."
"Awesome hotel. Breakfast unbeatable. I love the fact that they really honor the BW Rewards program. Excellent clean suites. Enough parking available next to your room. Tremendous restaurant to choose close to the hotel, an enormous luxury mall and a beautiful movie theater."
"My mom and I were in town for a girls weekend. We checked in before having dinner downtown and thought the room was decent. It looked like it had fairly had been remodeled with fairly new paint and furnishings in the last couple of years. Although the hallways and room itself had a lingering cigarette smoke smell, it's to be... More"
"Sirea and Sylvia were awesome, both deserve a raise. Both totally went out of their way to help me with anything I needed. And made my stay enjoyable and not so lonely by striking up conversations with me. Which means a lot when you are away from home. The rest of the staff was wonderful as well. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Will retun."
"other than the leak in the lobby hallway, it was great. breakfast was well done"
"This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!"
"We were booked in room 314. Upon arrival, the bathroom was flooded and had a constant drip coming from the center of the bathroom ceiling. Spoke with the manager about this situation, and was treated like a second class citizen b/c I was using points to pay for this room. The manager showed no concern for our situation, other than...

"We stayed for one night at this hotel during a trip to Nashville during the Rock-and-Roll marathon and our experience was very enjoyable, at a fraction of the cost compared to similar hotels in Nashville.

"The Dickinson Hampton Inn Suites is the best Hampton hotel I have stayed in. I have been a Hilton Honors Gold and Diamond member since 2007, and this is the best stay I have ever had with the Hilton properties. This hotel deserves your business if you are traveling to Dickinson ND."
"I have not stayed here is a year but what a nice surprise! everything is new all of the rooms have been remodeled and are very comfortable. Service is always good and friendly. Food service and bar are nice and convenient."
"The hotel was centrally located to where I needed to be. It is about 10-15 minutes from the Scranton Wilkes-Barre airport. The hotel entrance is a bit hidden from the main road. You must make a sharp turn then go up an incline before you see the main building and parking lot. Leaving, use caution as you must turn onto... More"

The atmosphere and ambiance is excellent. It is definitely within walking distance of all trollies just around the corner. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEST WESTERN AND WE WILL STAY HERE EVERY... More"
"This stay was one of the BEST stays i have ever had at a hotel. The scenery was very beautiful and sitting on the balcony was very relaxing and enjoyable. My daughter loved swimming in the pool, however i feel the hot tub could have been a little bit cleaner."

"The staff was friendly, professional and helpful. The accommodations were clean and convenient to all the local attractions."

This hotel served breakfast and had a better price on parking. Overall a great stay and I would recommend and stay again."
"We stayed in Room 426. The check-in was easy and fast. The entire staff was most friendly and helpful. The housekeeping was outstanding...our room was beautifully maintained and quickly prepared. The staff in the breakfast room was really great...felt like we were at home, but better. The entire weekend of our stay was excellent...could not have asked for better."
"We had a wonderful time. We planned this stay as a Christmas gift to our children, 7 and 8 yr olds tk watch their first Colts game.I was so happy to not have to walk outside to get to the stadium s ok we didn't have to pack their winter coats all day. We had dinner right down stairs at TGI Fridays and walked to the mall the night before.parking was easy and worth the money to know that my car was ok until after the game. We will definitely be staying again for games and just family time."

Our room was nice and cool and spotlessly clean. We... More"
"I have stayed a number of Best Westerns over the last 30 years in Canada the USA and this one at Wapakoneta, OHIO rates right up there with the best of them. Was easily accessible off the interstate. Very clean room and kitchen area. Staff were very friendly professional."

"I continue to find Hampton Inn the best choice for a chain hotel in the moderate price range. This hotel is no exception to the standard I have come to expect -- immaculate bathrooms, comfortable beds and a hearty, basic breakfast."
"The room was very clean and the staff were helpful and super sweet. The manager saw me struggling to fix my sandal and he came to my rescue with super glue and weights to keep my shoe clamped together. Made me feel like Cinderella! Thanks for going above in beyond!"

"We had a very nice stay at Comfort Inn in Fort Morgan - everything was great employees were pleasant and accommodating, room was updated, pool/spa temperatures were perfect and the free breakfast offered hot choices."
"I've stayed here a couple times and have been impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel and the friendly staff. I've stayed in many comparable smaller town hotels and the Fort Morgan Comfort Inn beats them all hands down."
"I arrived on a cold, frosty night after a long flight and drive. Front desk staff was courteous and made checkout a quick process. He even turned on the fireplace to help me thaw out while I checked in. The rooms are excellent-clean and nicely decorated and furnished in a contemporary design. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and... More"
"A frequent stop for us. Difficult to keep the temperature constant. Older but wellmaintained motel. Beds were comfortable and clean. Small rooms so stay with people you like. Quiet even with a train running through town."
"The room was very nice and very clean. The girl at the desk was very pleasant and helpful with restaurant recommendations. The continental breakfast was simple but very nice. The Hotel is very close and within walking distance to local restaurants. The two of us would stay there again!"
"Traveled with 4 adults. Arrived late at night and was a somewhat dubious about the hotel. Did not look very inviting from the outside, but since we had a reservation, we were there to stay. After checking in (hotel desk is located across the street), we made our way to the room. What a great relief to be greeted with... More"
"We arrived at the Bricktown Hotel but they had no record of our booking which was made through bookings.com. We decided to stay anyway and saved 20! Although the hotel is slightly out of town, they have a free shuttle to Downtown which we used in both directions. We found the staff to be helpful and charming. The room was... More"
"Stay away. Booked with Hotwire as a 3 star hotel with a 95 approval rate. Hotwire should be ashamed. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star. I feel dirty just thinking about this place. Only stayed for one short night and left with the gift of Bug Bites all over my legs . Website pictures are quite deceiving. The... More"
"Took almost twenty minutes to check in says it's a ramada has different brand everywhere carpet in hallway looks like a murder scene. Not happy at all. By the way I will take pic of bathtub check it out. 99.00 rooms. Tried to use the phone from the early 20's but no dial tone."
"We came here on our wedding night we figured we would save money on the hotel so we would have more for fun in the city. We didn't expect AMAZING but we did expect comfortable. When we walked in the building the man working the desk was to busy watching the game to really greet us. He checked us in... More"
"Forget staying there. Unless you want a trashed out hotel room, with clueless employees. Room that we booked was not available (King) so we ended up having to take a double room. First room we were given had nothing but cement floor in it. Clerk didn't know that entire floor was under construction. 2nd room, door wouldn't work, were told... More"
"I was a little worried when I saw the outside of Bricktown Hotel and Convention Center however, the inside has been beautifully redone and is absolutely wonderful! We will definitely stay here again. We stayed one night for the Thunder vs. Spurs game. Bricktown Hotel and Convention Center has free shuttle to the Arena which was a plus as we had no clue upon booking this hotel."
"Across from the bus station!!!!!!!!!! Horrible part of town made my family feet very uncomfortable. Halls were littered with trash, carpet is old and stained. This is not Bricktown I don't understand why they are able to use that name. Not even close to Bricktown! Pillows smelled, beds hard, walls are dirty. One of the employees told me they have... More"
"We booked this room through the internet. I had read that it had mixed reviews over the past several months. Well, let me just say that we were thrilled with our room. It was amazing. Our weekend started when we checked in at the front desk. The staff was very helpful with directions and recomendations on shopping and great places... More"
"The hotel was recently renovated and still has minor renovations going on. Rooms were clean, breakfast was tasty, and the staff members were very friendly. Used the shuttle service to downtown which was very convenient. Will stay again!!"
"I had a change of plans in my day and went in to check in at 11am or a little after so I wouldn't have to at 2am. The front desk staff was very accommodating and allowed me to with no hesitation. Room was very clean."
"had a great stay - room was very nice though I am Marriott Platinum I received a smaller Queen room so I was a bit disappointed I did not get a automatic upgrade nonetheless the staff was very friendly and the bar upstairs is amazing"
"Nice hotel but poorly ran. During my stay I asked to extend one night my reservation, it was okey'd at the front desk, to my surprise the next morning when I got checked out. To my surprise the front desk was rude and blaming the shift before about the mistake ( what do I care Is always the hotel... More"

Most definitely staying here again next time i am in okc. the rooftop bar was extremely fun-great drinks, food and atmosphere. walking distance to great restaraunts and not far from brick town, okc memorial."
"The service is always awesome. When you walk in you are immediately greeted by the person behind the counter the person who opens the door for you. Upstairs in the O Bar they took great care of our party. I left my phone and they immediately tracked me down. It was fortunate because I was in their free shuttle... More"
"The property is better than stated. I travel a bit (Lifetime Marriott Platinum) and gems like this are a rare find. Not only is the property exceptionally well designed but the service adds gravitas to experience. I don't review many properties, but when I do its because they are exception. I sincerely appreciate the ownership and management for making my... More"
"I rented a suite here for my daughter's 9th birthday party. We all had a fabulous time. The hotel staff, especially Seth and the late evening/night clerk were extremely nice, and accommodating. We swam, played games, and then watched a movie in the home theatre, which is an awesome touch that the hotel offers for free. The room was nice,... More"
"Very nice, clean and great rooms. Mary, the social director, extremely friendly, pleasant and an asset to the hotel. Some evenings there is a social event (5:30 to 7:30 wine, beer and snacks) with Mary hosting."
"Friendly helpful staff when asked anything! Ease closeness to the airport was awesome! Didn't care for the Bistro! Would of prefer a continental breakfast offered instead! Overall it was a very nice safe place to stay!"
"I'm working in KOP for a while so I'm staying 3 or 4 days a week. I have stayed at the Best Western for the last two weeks. I can't find a single thing to complain about. The Staff is outstanding. I stayed on the 3rd floor the first week. I made a reservation for the following week when I... More"
"From the moment we entered this hotel , we were warmly greeted by Andrew Leinbach , the Front Desk Manager. This was the first time we had ever stayed in this hotel and thanks to this wonderful manager and of course, the fine facilities and services , this will definitely not be our last. The manager made sure we got... More"
"Very pleasant stay! The front desk Bill was very helpful, very good hospitality for all hotel staffs too!"
"I merely stopped in at the Best Western last night to use the bathroom. I stopped at the wawa across the street and they had no bathrooms. when I pulled in, I noticed the grounds were very well kept. I, myself, work in the hotel business in Delaware so I have a high attention to detail. the lobby was bright... More"
"Excellent staff, cheery, helpful, courteous , polite, very professional. Our desk clerk Bill and the breakfast hostess Nina were amazing, they went out of their way to make us feel at home and welcomed. we need a scale and since they didn't have one at the hotel Bill went out and bought one, that was very kind of him, this... More"
"I cannot say enough good things about the comfort level and cleanliness of this hotel. Great breakfast items, vast majority of goodies. They even have fresh berries for your cereal toppings. Great coffee too. Very comfortable bed and lots of plush pillows. Clean workout room with good machines."
"During our stay at this establishment a lead assistant and a manger handled themselves extremely poorly. They were involved in a conflict which lead to very disappointed children and adults. The management needs to be retrained in customer service and not yell and have attitude with guest. They truly do not know how to run a business and should be... More"
"Building is 4 story, approximately 4 years old. The staff is very efficient and quite friendly (Just what you expect when in Mississippi). Good breakfast. The hotel is near the I-22 corridor and quite close to Natchez Trace Parkway. Rooms for my two separate visits were clean and spacious. Definitely a choice in the future."
"The new Best Western Plus motels are my favorite! Modern decor... Very clean... Your normal free breakfast. They seem to be even better quality then some holiday Inn expresses. Highly recommend, it was a real treat."
"This is a great hotel, good price, very clean, very nice stay. The rooms are nice, the beds were soft. The kids enjoyed swimming in the pool. It was an overall great place to stay we'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, clean place to stay that doesn't cost too much."

Although I did have to run the water my last night there... More"
"Jack Huff's has delivered again. We've found this to be one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. The rooms are bigger than the major chains, friendly staff and clean. It's a little old school with reservations and room keys but we'll worth it."
"The hotel was very clean. It was in a nice, safe neighborhood. The staff was friendly and polite. The breakfasts were better than most hotels. I broke my leg on the ski slope and the assistant manager went OUT OF HIS WAY to help me!!!"
"I have stayed here many times the last few months, 2 nights per week usually. I was referred to them by Bill's Towing after a Deer incident shut me down. Glad they did!

"Never stayed at a Comfort Inn but will definitely do that from now on! The staff was welcoming and accommodating, room was clean and comfortable, and the free morning breakfast had many choices and was delicious. It was a pleasant experience and will absolutely stay here when we pass through again."
"This is the 2nd of many business trips to PB. Great hotel in quite location. Close to several good eating spots. Nice clean room and bathrooms are big. Hot breakfast is great way to start the day. Staff is always friendly, even when outside smoking."
"Very nice hotel. The lobby was very modern and the staff were accommodating. The pool room and back patio were very nice. Would have liked a hot tub but none was available. The breakfast was warm and had a good variety. I liked having the access to the wifi and many places around the hotel to recharge my devices."
"Super close to things but off a main road so it isnt super busy or loud. Close to the beach, shopping center, and everything else you could need! The employees were helpful and cheerful. I couldn't ask for a better weekend trip. If you're staying for a long time, the rooms were spacious, and had full kitchens !"
"This Hilton Garden Inn is perfect. It is in a very strategic location in the city and adjacent to the train. The rooms were very clean and staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again on next trip to Buffalo."
"Thanks to other TA reviews, I was happy to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn for 2 nights. It is right downtown and steps from everything. If you are driving, you can park right in front, check in, and later move your car to the garage next door or even valet it. It didn't cost anything to park. The room... More"
"great location in downtown Ithaca. Starbucks conveniently located inside the building. front desk service is exceptional. both ladies working when we checked in were wonderful. rooms are clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend."
"We picked our daughter up from a 6 week music camp in the Catskills and decided to drive to Ithaca, Syracuse, Niagra Falls and Toronto afterwards. We usually stay in a Starwood hotel however there were none around so we choose the Hilton Garden Inn in downtown Ithaca because it was close to both Cornell and Ithaca College and easy... More"
"I was there from 9 to 13 March and I found the hotel simply perfect. The room was spacious and comfortable. The housekeeper staff very kind...everything was good at Hilton Garden Hill. I hope to come back there"

Rooms were spacious with refrigerator, microwave, and brun coffee maker.There were a lot of nice extras like a free shuttle to Cornell, coffee and cookies in the lobby, free garage parking, a great location a block from the...

"This review is long overdue. In fact I feel that I owe it to the owners. to anyone considering the Rose, even if it makes it harder for us to find a room in the future! The Catskill Rose is a small hotel in Mount Tremper, N.Y., some 10 miles West of Woodstock. It's in a quiet spot right... More"
"Stayed for five nights and ate in the resteraunt twice in September of 2015. Absolutely a fabulous stay. Hospitility is top notch. Felt very welcome. It was like staying at my best friends house. Thank you Peter and Rose. Howard"
"The google/website description is very misleading. It is NOT a BB and the term in-room continental breakfast is a joke. The website boasts in-room breakfast of scones and fresh fruit, which really meant cold, (though good when microwaved) scones and two apples. With the owner living upstairs and a restaurant on site it would be very easy and convenient to... More"
"Room was dirty to the point of trash under beds and dirty socks behind dresser. Mold in bathroom and kitchen area. At one point came back from visiting family to discover the door to the room open when I know it was locked when I left. Needless to say will not stay here ever again.."
"Every time we have stayed here, it has been excellent. The beds are comfortable, the rooms are all suites, the showers have great water pressure and temperature. The breakfast (complimentary) is delicious, and not just your standard muffins and cold cereal, either! Eggs, sausage/bacon, waffles (either with syrup or strawberries and cream), yogurt, cereal, muffins, bagels, fruit. Overall, a fantastic... More"
"The Hampton Inn in Bow, NH, is a wonderful hotel. Friendly and competent staff, very clean rooms, a very good FREE hot breakfast, and the location is great--easy access to I-93 and I-89. This hotel is very clean, and very modern. Try to do business with front desk employee MELISSA THORPE. She was very helpful and had a great attitude!"
"The staffing and room were great location of the hotel was perfect coming up from southern NE, going to Northern NH. The stay was relaxing and an easy on and off the highway with plenty of restaurants and pubs near by"
"Great family find. Staff was great! Pool kept kids busy. Eating area is welcoming. Close to all camps in NH and they are very tolerant of kid behavior. Right of highway 89. Nice drive into Concord, the State Capital and good ice cream. And The Candy Shoppe!"
"We stayed at this Inn for 2 days for a family wedding. The stay was very pleasant and the staff went out of their way to take care of this large party. We came from many states and I believe all were treated very well. Would definitely return to this Inn when back in this area."
"My husband had an early flight out of Minneapolis, so we needed something pet friendly (since we are out of town). This hotel accommodates pets, has a shuttle service starting at 4 a.m. to the airport and super comfortable beds! Room was clean, really big and had nice laminate, hard floors which was nice with the pets. I always wonder... More"
"The motel is being redone, so it was a little messy. My room was all new, and the mattress was wonderful! I have a bad back and knees but after the second night I walked out carrying my cane! I need to know what kind of mattress you are using. If you weren't so far away I would just move... More"
"We checked into into a different nearby hotel for stay-and-fly only to find there was nowhere to park our car and they wanted us to leave the keys so they could move our car the week we were gone. We had done stay and fly at several hotels NEVER did they move the car or want the keys. I call... More"
"My stay at the hotel was only one night but it was great. I so enjoyed watching the planes take off."
"Room was very dirty, pillow cases stained, bathroom nasty, and outdated and we cancelled and decided not to stay at all! the first room we were given ...the key didnt work and so the front desk reassigned us another room."
"Stayed in cabin 6. It was awesome. Everything about it was awesome. From the staff to other travelers staying there. Breakfast was great only problem with it was I ate too much. Rooms were very clean and fresh. I wanted to take the bed home with me it was so comfortable."
"This Best western i have stayed at and i have been too many of them.Again thanks to the great front desk staff that helped me. The pool was warm and very clean and they take great care of it. Room was clean and very clean,plus the maids did a great job cleaning it and they where there when we needed... More"
"Staff is friendly, Hotel is Clean and very comfortable. They offer breakfast and chocolate chip cookies! What more do you need. This place has a fitness center and a pool. I stay here for business and I never choose another hotel. Would Highly Recommend."
"We had the best service from a best western I have EVER had. ALL employees were so nice and helpful. We were even able to do laundry here. Score us. We were traveling the New England states and just needed to do some laundry to continue with the trip. The prices were reasonable for laundry and they have soap and... More"
"Only good thing is close location to downtown. Manager wrote me back defending that the mattresses will be replaced over the next couple of years but no mention of why they use blood stained bed covers. Otherwise I certainly won't be coming back ..."
"Older dated cheap motel: that was clean, with one of the two best beds in a 2 week trip ! For this class of motel, it is well worth a 5 star rating... better than a lot of motels that cost twice a much or more. Few defects in the tile work in the (dated) bathroom. Will return here any... More"
"This my second stay here and it has been great - consistent, predictable quality. I highly recommend it. Easy to find with a couple of good restaurants in the area then back on the road in the morning. A road warrior's dream!"
"We were looking for a quick morning drive into Atlanta, and hoped to not pay Atlanta prices. We were so impressed by this beautiful, new Best Western with a generous sitting area in an already spacious room! Front desk staff was exceptionally warm and welcoming. Great value!"
"It was wonderful."
"The room was clean and quiet Carol at the desk was wonderful she was informative quick check-in friendly the pool was great breakfast was really good"
"Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice."
"I was here for a few days and it was awesome. The rooms were really nice, really clean, they have really nice staff, and the free breakfast was great, I really enjoyed it. I recommend to stay at this hotel."
"We only stayed one night, but everything was great. The hotel employees were very helpful and friendly. The service was great. And, the breakfast is always a plus, especially when you have kids. You can sit down and enjoy yourself, then go to destinations."
"Stayed only one night as a walk in. Beautiful clean room, delicious breakfast, super friendly staff. Walked across the street to a grocery store and other shops. This property is a credit to the Hampton brand. Highly recommended."
"Centrally located hotel on Hilton Head. This is a lovely, safe facility for the single female traveler. If only they offered small bottles of wine in their snack purchase area (other Hampton Inns have the license), I would say this was perfection :)"
"We had a wonderful weekend at the Blue Sands Motel! Not only did they welcome our two standard poodles with open arms, but they were flexible with our late arrival and did everything possible to make our stay amazing. We loved the room (Room 5), which was well-appointed and quiet. The bed--a California King--was top notch. My wife said she... More"
"We were driving through for one night at Blue Sands Motel. Greeted so kindly, we chose them for price we were surprised at how nice for the money. I love to be able to walk to the beach and it fit the bill. I like quiet, check. I like a room that smells clean, check. Great bike paths for riding... More"
"My family of four plus our best behaved child, Boston Terrier, stayed here on 6/20/16-6/22/16 and loved our stay. In fact, this hotel was the highlight of a week long driving trip through NC. The employees were warm and friendly, especially Ms. Kim. She was very sweet to my kids and answered all of our questions. Kim gave great suggestions... More"
"We needed a hotel close to the Buffalo Airport as we had a flight booked early morning the following day. We choose Aloft Buffalo Airport on a whim as the photos and amenities seemed intriguing. We were pleasantly surprised on our arrival. Checkin went very smoothly. The lobby was very nicely decorated, modern and clean. Our room was no different.... More"
"Absolutely great service. Only con is that the low-emissions paring is apparently for everyone and is not enforced at all!! Owning a tesla it was very frustrating how tahoe's and escalades could park there and i couldn't!!!!"
"I stay at this hotel frequently and always receive friendly service but this time my experience at the bar was exceptional. I arrived later than planned and came downstairs just before the bar closed. Lindsay allowed me to place an order and provided friendly, attentive service that made this stay a positive experience. Rooms are clean and modern. I look... More"
"No1 stay very comfortable. Please change pillows made sleeping very hard."
"First time staying at a Hampton Inn. Was extremely satisfied by the service and accommodations. Impressed by cleanliness and appearance of the lobby and rooms. Great value. Nice breakfast spread included!"
"Wonderful staff!"
"We were in town for a wedding and this location was chosen by the bride and groom for the people coming in for the wedding. We have never been disappointed at Hampton in the past and we were not disappointed this time. The only thing difficult with this hotel was getting to it."
"Great spot to stay for 2-day conference. Clean, comfortable, convenient."
"One of the best hotels in Indy. We have been using this hotel for 10 years. Every time we are in Indy. You will enjoy it. Never had a bad time. The staff and food and building are clean sweet and good."
"This Hampton Inn is located within 5 minutes of the freeway, but has very little traffic noise. It is within walking distance to seven great restaurants and a Chase bank. Parking is free and the area is safe for walking in the evening. It has a fitness center, a pool, and free breakfast."
"Nice place to stay! I would recommend to anyone needing overnight stay. The rooms are clean and spacious. The beds are amazing! The staff here is very friendly and helpful! Very reasonably priced and great locations."
"Room and hotel was better than expected and employees could have not been more friendly!!!"
"Pleasantly surprised. Decently priced, clean, and super friendly staff. The discovery of a pool right outside of our widow the next morning, was an added benefit. We would definitely stay here again. The only drawback would be the weak Wi-Fi. I mentioned it to the front desk on check out and they seemed surprised even though many comments state the same thing."
"We were very disappointed in this hotel. The cable was out our entire stay, the pool was not filled (in july) and the bar/restaurant was closed. We wernt told about any of this. Was not worth the amount we paid. Very disappointed!"
"The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead."
"Our total experience was excellent. The staff was very friendly, the beds were soft and cozy, and the room was very clean and quiet. The best part of all was the fact we could check in and choose our room online with our iPhone. Physical check-in took a mere few seconds."
"We stopped at the Hampton Inn Kingsland on our way home from Naples, FL (the half way point). The hotel was very clean, beds were extremely comfortable, and breakfast was great the next morning before we hit the road on the final leg of our trip. The Steakhouse across the street was perfect for dinner!!"
"We always stay at this Hampton on our way down to Florida. It is always clean and well maintained. The staff is always courteous and friendly. It is located right off Interstate 95 and very convenient. We make this stop 3-4 times a year. Wouldn't stay anywhere else."
"I have gone every year since I was 3 years old and it is my favorite place on earth!!!! I love going to the beach, kayaking and playing cards with my friends and family :) The views are breathtaking and I love every moment I spend there!"
"This is a small very clean motel, just what you need to stay for the night without the frills. Steve was helpful, and you can walk to stores and restaurants. There were not many other travelers, so cannot comment on the noise as other reviews mentioned."
"My second year staying here and another great stay!!! Looking forward to next year!!! Nice accommodations in a beautiful little town, with great food and amenities near by. You find a better host anywhere!!!"
"Chirsty's Motel has been in Old Forge for years. Steve (manages and owns) is keeps the motel atmosphere very nice and quaint. The rooms are clean! Located on Rte 28 coming in from Thendara.

"Highly recommend others to stay, my accommodations were great ! It was recommended by a co worker and it was everything they said plus more. Travel to and from the airport was easy and fast. I will tell others of my experience and recommend your facility to everyone in my company. The staff, breakfast and rooms were more than I... More"
"This is the motel that began my boycott of all Motel 6's. Two obviously drunk people asked me for a ride and I said no, so they got belligerent. I made my way to the office to report them and they followed me. They waited for me for over half an hour outside the office, yelling profanities and threatening to... More"

"i have stayed in this hotel many times due to working in okc. Staff is very friendly and rooms are clean. I would recommend anybody that likes to stay in a clean, and reasonable price hotel. Breakfast is good as well."
"The heater was not on in the room and it was 24 degrees outside, There were huge spider webs. Could not connect to the internet and if I had been able to I would have known my flight was cancelled...."
"Really appreciate the quality, care and kindness of the Days Inn in Oklahoma City/Moore. We were traveling pretty late in the evening - booked the room on an app called Hotel Tonight, but the hotel staff gave us a better price and room upgrade than what was on the app. I would highly recommend this hotel - it was very...

"I will stay at this hotel every time I travel to Oklahoma City. The staff are friendly and professional. The room was very nice and most important clean. The bed is made with wonderful soft sheets. I have nothing negative to say. This was my 2nd stay. 5 star stay without the 5 star price."
"How great is it, having 5 little girls to find a hotel that's affordable, clean, and FITS US ALL LEGALLY!!! Best western rocks. We love it, and we're probably gonna be using them exclusively. We are a traveling family band, and we find these 2 queen suites to be just wonderful. Breakfast was better than average, and the pool rocked.... More"
"I was very pleased with my stay. My only compliant was that the waffle batter was extremely watery. Other then that, breakfast was really good. I also loved how this hotel offered so many amenities. Even though, I did not get a chance to use the fitness room, the business center, pool and spa were all very nice. I loved... More"
"if i needed help with anything they where rite there to help me and the pool was very nice rooms where up to date and breakfast was very good and i will be staying here again and i would tell my friends and family about this hotal as will"
"Amazing and wonderful! Clean!! Susan, at the front desk, went above and beyond to give us great accommodations on very short notice! We will be back! I Highly recommend! This is an updated hotel that gives a very good first impression when you walk in the door. The rooms don't disappoint. Very affordable too!"
"Very nice hotel, clean and cozy! Beds was very comfortable! We in joy to stay this place! Thank you"
"The staff is very personable and helpful. The room was very comfortable. I'm not a big breakfast person, but liked that there was a variety of items to select from. There's a grocery store close (and you don't have to get on a main roadway) to grab items for your frig. Will definitely stay at this hotel again!"
"Hotel was very clean. Wonderful accommodations.the staff were very friendly and helpful. They made sure everything was in order. We were in the city for a funeral and the staff and hotel made things easier for us. I would stay at this hotel again, and again."
"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast lady Sunday morning was more interested in talking to people then keeping bar filled and clean. She should be able to do both. I had a knee cart and she would see me trying to get around chairs and tables and just continued to talk to someone and did not help. I had surgery on my foot and needed a place with no stairs for few days. The room was comfortable, spacious and clean. I enjoyed the front porch to sit. Out during the day to get fresh air. Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days."
"Stay here as your last option! Oldest motel in Ocean Shores. Not cheap either. My junior suite was 140/night. I think It used to be 2 or 3 different motels that they made into 1 resort. I stayed in the 2-story building. I've never stayed here before so I thought I would try it because they accept pets, but I... More"
"Third time visiting this hotel!! Great stay will come again!! Real close to Riverbanks zoo!!"
"I almost always stay at Best Western properties. I like supporting independent owners. This hotel was everything you could want in an overnight stay. Clean, comfortable and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel."
"We were in town for the Pearl Jam show and used trip advisor to find this hotel. For the money, was very nice. Clean, friendly service, everything was easy. Breakfast was solid, good location and easy getting in and out of downtown. Would definitely stay there again."
"I have stayed at this location in the past and every time it gets better. The staff is friendly and helpful. The was clean and comfortable. The layout of the room was very comfortable. The breakfast was hot and ready. The food was fresh. The location is well located."
"Very good experience. Easy on and off the interstate. Comfy room, Quiet, well appointed, clean (and I am picky). Competent and welcoming staff. I would come back to this hotel if I was in the area again. Would also recommend it ."
"Great hotel off the I-77 corridor for weary travelers. Was offered holiday special cheaper than the AAA rate. Wonderful desk person Tatiana was super helpful. When we went to our room we found really plush surroundings and ultra modern suite with all amenities you would need including hair dryer, shower gel and shampoo/conditioner in little dispensers in the shower area.... More"
"This was a stop for us on our roadtrip to Florida. Had everything we needed, except they did not provide a crib, even though it was requested in my reservation"
"Probably as perfect hotel as you are likely to find. Latest updates, friendly staff. Clean room and bathroom!"
"The hotel is up to date and very clean. The rooms have flat screen televisions and new beds. The staff is very helpful and had many good recommendations for good food nearby. The breakfast was of good quality and had good selection. The managers reception on weeknights was also a plus!"
"My stay at Comfort Suites was very relaxing. They have every amenity that you could think of. They had an excellent hot breakfast every morning, a heated pool, and a fitness room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone because they are very understanding of your wants and needs. They will try their best to get you what you need."
"Comfort Suites was so accommodating to us during our visit. We made an error and did not book the last night of our stay. Even tho they were fully booked for Saturday night, the staff did everything they could to successfully find us a room. Thank you again! Also, bedding and pillows are wonderful!"
"Gave us the keys to an ocupied room. Waited 20 mins or more to figure out the attendant had given the room we reserved away to a friend. In his words for free Charged twice for our room. Ended up being placed in a smoking room that was filthy. Shredded blankets. Loud wild crowd in parking lot and on... More"
"This was the first two nights stay of wifee and mine 17 day on the ground trip across Georgia, S N Carolina. Place was iffy to begin with. No friendly front desk welcome, dents on the outer door with a missing security latch on the inside and holes punched in the bathroom wall didn't help. I placed a straight... More"
"That was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed. Well, actually the second Super 8 in a row that was so awful. Everything was so dirty that we didn't even take our clothes off when we went to bed. The towels had stains all over, the bathroom floor was covered in black hair, the bathtub had soap scum... More"
"I gave this a 'this room is great for free wifi and sightseeing' review because there wasn't an option for absolutely nothing. We did have wifi, and we got to see a few drug deals in the parking lot, so that could qualify as sightseeing. The room itself was acceptable, the beds were clean, however, they should rethink their free pet policy as our room had ticks, and so we left, after being there two hours. The pictures on hotels.com are NOT pictures of this hotel. The staff was amazing...refunded our money, very apologetic, absolutely outstanding customer service."
"We had to quickly find a hotel late at night, after coming to town for a family emergency. Super 8 had room, and so we went ahead and got a room there. The woman at the front desk gave us our key and told us the room number. The exterior of the hotel isn't the best, but I wasn't too... More"
"Room had roaches and the toilet was stained the cover wasn't clean. I left out and came back a short time later and I never received room service. I called down to the front desk and the front desk clerk stated that no one was available to clean the room and that everyone had gone for the day. Wow I... More"
"Staff was friendly, service was very good, hotel very convenient to restaurant and other stores, great freeway access, suite was very spacious, only issue their equipment in breakfast was not working at times."
"Everyone is so nice and accommodating and they went out of their way to be sure everything was satisfactory. The location is great for attending the Masters Golf Tournament. We've been staying there since it first opened."
"As previously mentioned in other reviews, check-in is across the street on the 2nd floor, so I was prepared for that. Got a basic 2 bedroom oceanfront on the 4th floor. Room was nice. Full size fridge, stove, microwave, all the basics. Kitchen had plates, silverware, cups, other utensils and appliances, everything you needed. Basic bathroom with a hair dryer.... More"
"My business partner stayed there in Moses lake great hotel, fabulous view, front Desk Girl Denise was great treated us well. Food was amazing. Defenetly passing the word for this Hotel.They are in the middle of a remodel which is wonderful to see the quality on their Hotel"
"The staff were very cautious and helpful. I really liked the fresh omelet / eggs option with the breakfast. The restraint is convenient and good with a great view of the lake. Internet worked with no issue and I cannot say that in some of my stays."
"Very nice place to stay. Friendly and very accommodating. Newly renovated rooms were great and very clean. We stay here almost every weekend during hunting season, always have geat service. The food in the restaurant is always good."
"When travelling south for our annual snowbird trip, the Best Western at Moses Lake, Washington has often been our first stop. This November, 2015, the price was right with a quiet lake view, a sliding door for fresh air, a very comfortable bed with quality bedding, a full hot breakfast in their large restaurant and an extremely friendly staff who...

"Nice restaurant on premises, wonderful if you arrive late and tired and don't want to go out to find something to eat. Varied menu, surprisingly good food and table wine by the glass. Breakfast, which came with the room, was also good. Omelet station, waffles, and an assortment of other breakfast items including fruit, yogurt, cereals, breads, and sausage or... More"
"Hotel staff has been very accommodating and making my stay a wonderful one. They have went out of their way to ensure the smallest details are taken care of, just to make my stay more comfortable. The Paradise restaurant and lounge is second to none here in Moses Lake. Everyone is so friendly and courteous, especially Lisbeth. I recommend going... More"

"My stay at the Best Western was amazing. First of all, the staff was very nice, polite, and very helpful, especially Ashleigh. They had an awesome breakfast with a nice view of the lake.

"My wife and I stayed here on our first couples getaway when we were dating. We are back for the holiday as a quiet getaway. Well kept rooms, great view, good service and central to everything. Not sure anyone could expect anything more.Glad you made it back to stay with us Mike! Thank you for your feedback and we are very pleased you enjoyed your getaway with us."
"Upon checking in, the front desk couple was super friendly. I'm guessing they were the owners maybe The room was spotless. I was super happy to see that the window opened so I could listen to the waves crashing while I relaxed. I had a room with a queen bed, it also had a table w/ chairs, a loveseat, comfortable... More"
"I would never stay at this hotel again. My room in the south tower, 1927 was filthy dirty and it looked like the carpets had not been cleaned in years. The lamp was broken, the wall by the AC looked like it had severe water damage and probably mold. I woke up to cold showers every morning and the shower... More"
"I spent 2 nights in this hotel with friends for a bachelor party. It would have taken very little for this hotel to meet our needs and it still fell short. The room was old and in need of renovation ( no big deal on that one) but when we arrived all the lights didn't work. We quickly found they... More"
"The website for the hotel said you can be 18 to stay however when my friends and I arrived we were told that since we were not 21 we could not stay and after 30 minutes of speaking with my mother and nearly working out a solution so my friends and I could stay we were eventually told that unless... More"
"we had a very good check in and the staff helped in everyday, I took a card so we could call next summer to stay. we enjoyed our stay."
"I purchased my room a week in advance. Had a low rate. I was really impressed for it being a lower rate hotel. My room was clean and cozy. Looked as though it was updated. Everything worked great. The bed was very comfortable. The free breakfast was accommodating. The staff professional and nice. I would stay here again!"
"I went with my extended family (brothers, kids, uncle and grand parent), we took more than 9 rooms for a week. We had great vacation! Friendly staff, great pool, near the beach. room are clean. The wifi is not very performing, that would be my only complain."
"Incredible 2 1/2 star hotel. Things that's really standout in this hotel are cleanliness, space, and the slick modern look. This hotel can easily be a 3 1/2 to 4 star. If your staying near the domain, feel completely comfortable to book this location. I hope this place can keep its high quality and prestige for years to come."
"Excellent property that was very clean. Staff was extremely friendly."
"First time staying in this brand-new hotel and we loved it! Free gourmet breakfast with lots of options including omelets and breakfast sandwiches! Great gym with strength training cardio machines and lots of TVs. And an attached laundromat (coin-operated). Free parking, nice outdoor pool/cabana, free internet of course, and a great hip-looking lounge! Only issue was the gym's water... More"
"Rooms are spacious, clean, and staff are excellent. The ONE thing that stood out (unfortunately), was the coffee. I am a coffee drinker. I've had too many brands to count. The coffee used at this hotel is absolutely the worst I have ever had. It has a terrible after-taste, something like 1-part coffee and 1-part dirt from the parking lot.... More"
"Location is perfect. We have stayed 5 to 6 times and always had a nice stay. Room is always clean. It is quiet and clean hallways. The staff does a good job of keeping the lobby and breakfast area very clean."
"I have a very picky family, when it comes to hotels, and this hotel delivered. Friendly staff, easy check-in/check-out process, and really comfy rooms. A recommended hotel for business or family travelers! Good location too!"
"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. It has a special inner court to walk your pup. A very nice discount when someone in your family is in the local hospital. Centrally located for access to St. Luke Hospital, downtown Boise. It is quiet, the staff is helpful and understanding to your coming and going at odd times day and night and... More"
"We stayed as a family here one night in the summer and a week in December. Nice place. The breakfast area was always clean and the breakfast area manager was obviously well liked by the repeat business customers as well as us."
"Great, clean place to stay. Needed to be near the airport. Breakfast was over priced. But I would still recommend this hotel. It was a little difficult to locate at night. Could use a street light and hotel sign at the corner. Almost ran over curb."
"I booked a 7 night adventure for my family thru Expedia but I had to change plans cause our dates were conflicting. I had cancel current reservation on March 21. In the info for the booking it stated no charges will be made if cancelled before April 21. I have been waiting now 10 days and no refund for deposit... More"
"Everything was just lovely. The managers were friendly and helpful. The room was large and had everything we needed. The pool was clean and nice and the beach access was great. I wish we could've stayed longer!"

It's not very far from all the major stores and attractions on International Dr. It's tucked away, so it's very quiet. There is a Walmart right across the street and a Dollar Tree and some other stores really close by... More"
"Even though Chris and Sheri were out of town during our stay, they made arrangements for my family and I. The lake is so peaceful - the cabins are all located off a small dead end of the lake, so there is little boat traffic. The docks were appropriately maintained. We didn't rent a boat, but there are a few... More"
"This is a newer hotel so the property shines. Yet even newer hotels can lose their luster without great staff. The attitudes by everyone in this property were excellent during my entire stay...Front Desk Staff, Breakfast Staff and Housekeeping. If you want to feel welcomed and valued during a trip to Columbus this property should be considered. Their training and... More"
"I stayed at this hotel recently. A few things to note. 1. I got the hotel on priceline for 41 for the night. What a steal! 2. We arrived at the hotel and owner did not seem pleased that two men would be sharing one bed. His look of disgust on his face was clear. That made me feel very... More"
"Repeat customer planning our next visit. Comfortable rooms, great food and accommodating hosts. Ken and Lisa are always helpful in suggesting additional exploring options in the area, such as a farmer's market or local artists."
"Enjoyed our stay there. The staff was very friendly. Love taking our 2 dogs with us when we travel"
"I never write these kind of things but this time I thought it was warranted. My family and I just finished a stay at the Springhill Suites by Marriott on Pensacola Beach and it was great. Honestly one of the reasons it was so great was because of one of the bartenders named Crystal. She was so wonderful. Very friendly... More"
"This is probably the best hotel we've stayed at. Very clean, Smelled good, and rooms were very spacious. Even the bathroom was nice and big.

"We spent one night at he Drury Plaza hotel and will definitely be returning the next time we are in St. Louis! The room was spacious and comfortable, the hot breakfast buffet was delicious, and you even get a voucher for a free drink at happy hour. The hotel is also within walking distance of the arch and ballpark village.... More"

For this price and compared to the... More"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel, it was a beautiful hotel without being too nice for our family with 4 small children. My husband and I love nice boutique hotels, but with small kids that's not going to happen. This was a great hotel for a combination of beauty and practicality. Also, we had a great view of... More"
"At one point I was a loyal repeat customer to this place. Although most would complain about the tacky decor or the dirty burn marked sheets and blankets im not one to make a big deal about it.

"We had reservation for a month. Day we check in, they tell us they forgot to charge us the holiday rate. They said it was a mistake on their part that the girl was in a hurry to leave the night we made the reservations. We had an email confirmation showing the amount, it still didn't matter. Suddenly instead of... More"

Room smell, don't walk around in bare feet carpet hasn't been used in months. Bathroom grease stains on floor and in tub. Sink doesn't drain. This is not a family motel... More"
"The place is a complete dump! The rooms are super small and cramped. They don't care about their customers and house keeping could do a way better job on the cleanliness of the rooms. There's not enough parking and the chance of your vehicle getting hit by another is highly possible. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone staying... More"

"This hotel is comfortable and the staff were friendly. Rooms were clean with Matrix hair products. The breakfast was a bit disaapointing, but the muffins were excellent. Room 118 is right off the breakfast area and if you want something a bit quieter, select another room. Close to amenities!"
"I have stayed at this Microtel over 20 times in the last four years. I always stay there when I travel to Scranton and the surrounding area. I do so for many reasons: Price: the rates are low and are even better through AAA and similar groups. The rate includes a breakfast which is free and good, though limited in... More"
"MIcrotel's business model is that the rooms are small,but they are clean, well appointed and there some nice courtesies in Otis Spunkmeyer Cookies and 24 hour coffee/tea.The staff was polite and responsive. I received a callback about lost Crocs within 48 hours."

Hotel is close to lots of big box stores. It's a bit more than I want to pay in Scranton but worth it for peace of mind... More"
"I can't find any fault with our stay. Well, maybe the entrance is not well identified and, on two occasions, the card-key to the room failed."
"This Microtel is immaculately clean, everything is sparkling and the service is topnotch and responsive. The beds are very comfortable and the bathrooms are up to date and immaculate. There is even a mini-Laundromat with coin operated washing machine and dryer. Every morning there is an elaborate breakfast with lots of choices of fresh, tasty food."

I will never stay... More"

"Very nice hotel that was close to everything we needed. Did not have to rent a car but still had a great time, lots to do within walking distance or short bus ride. Rooms were clean and well taken care of during our visit."
"Absolutely the worse motel/hotel we had ever stayed in. No elevator. Steep unkept stairs. First impression upon entering, was very poor. Walls dirty, light switches dirty, dirty torn lampshades with mold in neighboring room. Sheets appeared clean. Bathroom the worse. Bathmat appeared dirty, when lifted it was mold from the underside. Floor, wall, corners, ceiling all needed cleaned and renewed.... More"
"For the location, right outside of Savannah, the price can't be beat. The staff is very polite and accommodating, the motel is always busy with travelers, so you can assume it's a decent place to stay. The breakfast the following morning is better than most, they actually have pretty decent food. I enjoy staying here, and will come back"

"I was pretty impressed with how clean the hotel was. It seemed to have recently been remodeled, and it made my stay quite pleasant."
"I don't normally write bad reviews unless I was extremely unhappy with the experience hence this rating. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The previous guest had left the toilet clogged and the hotel never bothered to unclog and clean it. When we arrived at the room and notified the front desk, the maintenance guy blamed it... More"

"We had a great visit to MotorCity casino and Detroit in general. We were in town to see the Tigers and White Sox play, and the hotel shuttled us all around Detroit so that we didn't have to get in our car at all.

"This place is the worst ever!! First of all, we had to pay for our entire stay up front (before we saw the room). Then when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarettes and had cigarette burns on everything. There were roaches coming in under the door and smashed bugs on the wall! There was no hot water... More"
"This is the second time staying here with my wife. Just like before, it was a great time. the rooms have plenty of space, the are clean and comfy, and carry the Victorian era theme in them. The whirpool bath tub is always a nice touch. The area where the toilet is very small ( I am 5'4 200lbs), not... More"
"We stayed ten nights at Grandma's Featherbed celebrating our ten year wedding anniversary in September. We were thrilled with our experience.

We got our AARP discount, and when we got to the room... More"
"Jenell and Micheal and the overnight guy we re extremely welcoming and informative. The rooms were big and clean and we slept well, even though we got in late. Breakfast was rather standard hotel breakfast but they had the coffee, oatmeal and waffles needed to get us on the road without being hungry."
"easy check in with staff that was responsive with suggestions to my restaurant questions making a great recommendation. I checked in via the pre-checkin option and was haned my key as soon as i gave them my name. I requested a good seafood restaurant recommendation nearby and they immediately recommended two with a personal preference for Jax Restaurant. It was... More"
"Easy to get to. Room was clean and the staff was friendly. About the only Hiccups were a malfunctioning fire alarm that was silenced after a few seconds and some inconsiderate guest slamming their door. Can't blame the Inn for that. Breakfast is provided in the morning and the area is kept well maintained by staff. Room has a wall... More"

"Do not stay here. Filthy. Sleep in your car if you need an alternative. The board of health should close this hotel down. The manager was rude, the rooms were filthy, smelled like smoke. Would not even sleep under covers."
"Everything at this hotel was great we had a great time it was clean the people are nice everything was good so going back to Maine I would definitely stay here and that would let everybody know to stay here"
"The Pros... Cheap, clean, quiet The Cons... We were supposed to be in adjoining rooms with the rest of our family for a graduation trip/celebration.

"I have been all over the island and no one does a better Mai tai. I stopped at a exclusive resort restaurant that charged 16.00 for thier Mai tai's and they were a little weak. They have great happy hour prices and maintain a tasty Mai tai with a punch."
"For basic accommodations, this place is perfect. Right in the center of town, welcoming staff, clean room, couldn't ask for more. With a restaurant on-premises, it was perfect for breakfast and great for sunset in the afternoon."
"This hotel combines historic character with great location in Lahaina. The room was comfortable, with outdoor balcony to enjoy as well with views of courtyard and harbor beyond. We had no troubles with noise, though our room faced the inside courtyard which probably helps. Overall, a wonderful stay at a reasonable price (included parking and wifi). Note that there are...

"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the pool hours didn't accommodate our after 10 P.M. arrival, the bartender still served us the length of time we needed to relax after our long journey. Rooms were great, although we wished for an exhaust fan in the bath. 3 people needing showers in the morning necessitated this feature. Overall, we were pleased with our experience."

All the girls were able to get ready together. The photographer came and took pictures there. The breakfast each morning was very good. Make your own waffles with all kinds of goodies... More"
"The staff is friendly and accommodating without being ingratiating. The facility is clean and well maintained. The hotel is close to the highway and easy enough to find, though just a bit tucked away. This makes it a little unsettling to find the first time, but it makes it a quiet corner to get away."
"I have stayed at the Lofts on Pearl for the past couple of years following a Bills game. The rooms lack nothing. They are perfect as well as the staff. They are so welcoming and take care of our needs while we are visiting . Beautiful place !!!!!!"
"Horrible experience at this hotel. Water was leaking under the sink, bathroom door was kicked in, mold coming out from behind the shower stall, toilet wouldn't flush and, curtains torn off of the curtain rods. Coffee maker didn't work dirty hallway . Wi-Fi was poor. I couldn't even believe it so I took many pictures. Do not stay here you... More"
"Rm 314 was great! I chose this room because of the oversized clawfoot tub. It would be great for a longer stay since it's basically a one bedroom appartment with a full kitchen, 4 seat dining table and separate living room. There is no view from this room but who cares! I had a romantic weekend planned and time out... More"
"The Armstrong is a hotel with a lot of character, perfectly situated in Ft. Collins to allow easy access to the dining and shopping areas of town.

"We stayed one night while on a road trip to Chicago. If we ever pass through Fort Collins again, we will definitely be staying at this hotel. It is conveniently located (restaurants, and pretty strolling all around), and if you request a quiet room, you night not get a view, but you will get a very good night's sleep. Parking... More"
"We checked in and after trying two rooms we immediately checked right back out and slept in the car. The beds had hair in them and makeup and dirt on the pillow cases and sheets. The first room was a non-smoking room that smelled so badly of cigarettes we couldn't stand it and it also had hair in the bed,... More"
"We had a very large room, large table, large TV with many channels but no HD, fridge, microwave, good AC, nice furniture, and a small bathroom with limited counter space. Staff was very friendly. The bed was comfy but the blanket stopped a foot short of the pillow (maid didn't pay attention to how she made the bed). The price... More"
"The staff at this hotel is awesome, always greeting everyone with a smile and looking to help if you need anything. The rooms were clean and comfortable.

"We were through Prosser in Feb, and decided to try Barn Motor Inn, an independent instead of the well known chain. Mistake. The place was empty, and, I found out, for good reason. Light coverings with no extra blankets on beds. No thermostat, just a very loud heater/cooler with high/low type settings. No hair dryer (are you kidding me.. I... More"
"I understand the whole middle of nowhere so we set our own prices but holy cow this is ridiculous! 100 for two double beds in a dingy room The only cool part was the restaurant which I was too afraid of the prices to actually give it a shot. If you have money to blow for absolutely the bare minimum... More"
"My suite was definitely ample for one person. It was well-appointed and clean. While there was no air conditioning, the fresh air let in by the easily opened windows proved quite refreshing (not much need to worry about too much outside noise :-). I was traveling with a group that stayed five nights at the hotel... I managed to get... More"
"We stayed one night here while passing through town. The room was comfy, and the hot breakfast was better than expected. Each member of the staff that we encountered was very friendly and helpful.

"I believe in the saying you get what you pay for. So, when I came across this hotel (being on a tight budget due to a unplanned 10 hr trip from TX) I booked it and hoped for the best. It was about 30 cheaper then the hotels around it. Although it had great reviews I was skeptical because of... More"
"It's a shame that I didn't do more research as far as the definition of a hunters hotel . It kind of ruins my Outlook on the town of Benkleman,Ne.

"The hotel was clean and the staff were great!! The rooms were clean and the amenities were wonderful. They have a putting green, workout room, heated hot tub and pool, as well as one of the best breakfasts at any hotel.

"We recently spent 4 nights at this hotel. We originally booked for 2 nights but were so impressed by the hotel ambience that we stayed an extra 2. From the moment we checked in we found the staff to be warm and welcoming. The hotel is within walking distance of the Alamo and Riverwalk but the hotel also offers an... More"

"Great Hotel. Very comfortable and the staff is really helpful and nice."
"This is an excellent location, priced right. Best of all was the staff, especially Stephanie! She assisted the family with room needs and was extremely professional and courteous. Every family member commented on the kindness shown by Stephanie as unlike that found at many locations. The location is near both Dallas and Ft. Worth making it easy to access either."
"Our room was very clean and comfortable. The beds and pillows were perfect. Teresa, the manager, was very welcoming to us. Although the pool was not open yet we enjoyed the warm Texas sunshine on the patio. There is also a grill if you want to BBQ. The complimentary breakfast was good and the staff replenished it as needed. We... More"
"The room was very nice, the A/C was phenominal in the room, a quiet and pleasant stay. The staff was very nice. The only downside of the stay was the internet cut in and out through the day. Overall, great experience!"
"Other than the fact that our keycard not working when we arrived at our room on the 2nd floor, it was an excellent place to stay! The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Would recommend it to a friend."
"we were very pleased to be able to use computer to check in with our airline to save time at the airport."

"My girlfriend has spent the last eleven weeks at the Country Inn and Suites while she has been attending law enforcement training in Athens. I would stay with her a few nights a week and was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. All of the amenities from the comfortably lobby, to the pool and hot tub, to the continental breakfast...

Rooms were clean, fridge and microwave in room, nice pool area, it has it all! Staff was friendly and most helpful! Lots to do in the area and would definitely stay here again!"
"I recently stayed at the Newark Garden Hotel for a gathering. It had the nostalgic allure of an older hotel, and immediately the hotel's simple charm and genuinely friendly staff won me over. The bed was quite comfortable, the room was clean and spacious, full hot breakfast was included, and there was a good sized conference/dining room at the hotel... More"
"Home2Suites Canton has roomy suites with comfy beds, kitchen area, and living area. Staff are very friendly and helpful both at the desk as well as breakfast. The coffee is really good and the make your own Belgium waffles are delicious!"
"Recently brought the family to Canton for a visit with friends and family. After reviewing a number of options on Trip Advisor, we chose Home2 Suites for location, a very competitive rate, pool and complimentary breakfast. Our experience exceeded all expectations! Jennifer, the General Manager, and her entire staff went out of their way to accommodate us on a number... More"
"Went for Thunder Over Louisville 2015. VERY polite and friendly staff and desk crew. Ice makers were broken on 2nd and 3rd floors, but there were personnel on site actively working the problem, so it wasn't so bad. Perfect location in the heart of Downtown Louisville. Would certainly stay again next year!"
"I stayed for one night with a couple friends. We were in town for a concert. The hotel was clean, conveniently located, nice, and a good value. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly."
"The hotel was excellent and the staff were great! The cleaning people and night desk staff were especially nice and helpful, and they even made a dog out of towels once. The room had a small refrigerator which was a nice surprise, and the gym was surprisingly well-stocked with equipment."
"I called the manager Matt for two straight weeks and left multiple messages. He felt it was unnecessary to return any of phone calls so my stay was ruined. I would never stay here again."
"We used 10,000 Marriott points for our stay in room 117. It was roomy, and had a massive closet. The room had a fridge, dishwasher, sink, stove, and expanding desk. (Yes, you could live there.) USA Today and the Omaha World Herald were provided for free. It is true that the hotel is hard to find we missed it on... More"
"From the front desk to the room and next day breakfast this place is first class. It is crowded due to being the homebase of Cox Cable employees - so book ahead! Just off 680 on the west side - you can get to anywhere in Omaha from here quick."
"Wonderful woman at front desk and man working as general maintenance."
"Loved our stay however Elevator was broken and it took forever to catch. Great neighborhood!!!! Stores and restaurants galore!"
"Looks like a higher priced, well appointed hotel room. Clean, roomy, and modern. Walking distance to the Outback Steakhouse. Wireless internet was fast. Nice breakfast. Room was quiet. I would recommend this, especially to business travellers."
"Like New. Exactly as booked. Room excellent .. shower head not great. Fantastic breakfast with outstanding breakfast lady! Great value for price. Would return without question. And you would too. Just do it."
"this hotel happened to be the last one to have rooms for the time me and my friends were down there! Talk about a nasty rundown place, first off we walked in our room and the sheets and bed looked unfit to sleep on, the smell was nasty and we had to let our room air out, when we went... More"
"We have been coming to the Dunes every fall for more than 10 years. It is a vacation we enjoy more every year. The cottages are like our home away from home. The staff are extremely accommodating. We highly recommend the Dunes!"
"Our family has now been coming to The Dunes on the Waterfront annually for close to a decade now and we are never disappointed. This is a rare gem of a place, with gorgeous grounds and views, lovely, well-equipped cottages and a friendly and attentive staff. What's not to love The Dunes offers a peaceful respite from the hustle and... More"
"We stayed here two nights and it was very nice. Nothing fancy, but very clean, quiet and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful! They have a small breakfast in the morning, which was enough for us (cereal, doughnuts, yogurt, etc.) They always have water, coffee and tea available in the lobby as well as microwave popcorn and Famous... More"
"We stayed two nights at the Nordic Lodge. We found this place online and it was everything it was advertised to be. The staff was very friendly, bed was very comfortable and we loved the private patio off our room and also the large deck off the pool area. Both faced the woods. Our room was equipped with a small... More"
"This was our second time staying at the Maple Leaf Motel. Cindy, the owner / manager takes great pride in the cleanliness of the rooms. And she loves her flowers! It is a gem right on the main road into Charlevoix. Prices are reasonable. This is definitely our go-to place to stay in that area of the State."
"We booked this place on a whim and how fortunate we were! Quiet, clean and roomy! Loved the owner! She was priceless and so accommodating! Super kid friendly..pool was so clean and sparkling! Cant say enough about this place! Definitely coming back! My boys ages 7,11 and 14 loved it as well as my 3 year old grand daughter! We... More"
"This place is still under construction for updating their rooms but we were placed in a new room that was very impressive. Everything was new, furniture, fixtures, microwave, coffee pot and fridge. Very clean. Nice continental breakfast. LOVE the new policy when there is a noise complaint...the rowdy guests get one warning and after that, the police will be called.... More"
"Nice hotel, staff were the best I have interacted with in years. Accommodations were very clean."
"Only regret I have is the breakfast, could add bacon and sausage and make the breakfast a true hot breakfast."
"The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel."
"We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!! My wife and I arrived at 11:20PM and no one was in the front desk. We waited for 20 minutes unattended and finally someone came to check us in. While we were in the room, we found one of the twin bed did not have blanket/comforter. We called 3 times and the last answer was the house keeper left and he would send us one TOMORROW MORNING. It was 1:30AM by then and we were all exhausted and decided to give up and sleep with A/C off."
"Most disgusting place I have ever stayed. Dirty smelly and unexpected vistors in the middle of night who had been given a door key from reception! Reported this incident to reception after getting rid of the man. She just laughed said the man was booked in the following day. After making further inquiries no one can be given a key... More"
"We booked this hotel while we were traveling to Florida. Very inexpensive so we were apprehensive but on check-in we were very pleasantly surprised. Room was a 2 room suite with king bed, microwave and frig. It was clean and very comfortable. The next surprise was the free full breakfast the next morning. Would definitely use this chain of hotels... More"
"We were traveling to the east coast and needed a one night stay so we called ahead and booked with Baymont because he informed us of the Brand new remodeled room. We got to the room and found new carpet and it ended there. The tv was an antique with a remote that would not operate this old set, the... More"
"Filthy hotel! Bed bugs or fleas, not sure which but we scratched all night. Dirty rags, dirty tub, nasty carpet and sheets. Should have been tipped off when I had to wade through trash overflowing the trash can in the breakfast area. Mgr. wouldn't return phone calls (3) and when I finally reached him, he said he'd give me 10.... More"
"Stayed one night, requested a room with refrig on first floor. Request granted PLUS kitchenette!' Room very large, well laid out and great lighting. VERY clean and comfortable. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Snacks, soda, water, chips and ice cream sold in little market in lobby. Highly recommend this hotel. BEST PLACE EVER at this GREAT price!!!! Thanks to... More"
"We do a lot of business traveling and have stayed in hotels with kitchenettes that have nothing to cook with and frankly, we don't travel with pots and pans! This Mainstay was fully equipped with everything needed right down to paper towels! The desk clerk was extremely friendly and helpful as was the employee in the breakfast area. The room... More"
"Awesome pool, comfy beds, pillows. Great view of downtown, and easy to get to plaza or to crown center."
"They are very accommodating and friendly!!-The only downside is there is no free parking at the hotel but besides that...it was great"
"The hotel was very nice , and the staff was very freindly"
"Awesome!"
"Very nice and clean, would stay again!"
"The staff was excellent! The only frustration I had was the cost of parking, very expensive."
"We have stayed here several times.  Always enjoyable.  Clean rooms, great staff.  Love the glass walkways to crown center."
"Definitely went above and beyond for our occasion. Even sent up a special dessert. We have many fond memories of staying when it was the Hyatt and was not disappointed. Great job. Especially at check in..our clerk was amazing. He made all details of our stay comfortable. Thanks."
"Great hotel! I enjoyed the city views from this high rise building."
"Great stay very nice"
"Very clean, nice updated rooms. Felt so comfortable in there I walked around barefoot and sat on the floor."
"We loved our stay. It was right by the Crown Plaza. We took the sky bridge to the crown plaza. The hotel was right beside the aquarium and Lego land. It was very clean and pleasant."
"The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional."
"We stayed at this hotel when it was a Hyatt sot that was some time ago.  I would say that everything has improved since Sheraton took over.  The Staff is excellent as well as the restaurant and bar.  The room was very comfortable and quiet."
"This hotel was everything you you want in a hotel, staff was quick to point out how to avoid additional charges, volunteering services and assistance. Beds were nice, clean and the pillows were almost comicly fluffy. Close to everywhere in KC we wanted to go"
"We were in Kansas City to see \"Once\" at the Kaufmann Performing Arts Center and decided on this hotel for a good location, near the venue. We were beyond pleased with our stay in the Sheraton. The hotel is classy and the area is vibrant. So much to take in and appreciate. Our stay was a \"5\" across the board."
"We truly enjoyed our stay. The room was great and we definitely appreciated the hotel shuttle service to near by attractions and resturants. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
"This hotel has changed a bit in the lobby since that day in July 1981 when the skywalks collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring others.I was working at The Kansas City Star then and remember that disaster very well. The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is. The Hyatt Regency disaster has gone down as one that has raised building safety to a much higher standard."
"We were here for a three-day dance convention. We travel a lot, and this hotel was very excellent. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I have is the service in the restaurant was lacking. When I went for dinner, I had to pour my own glass of water and waited almost 20 minutes for a server to finally come to my table. Otherwise, the hotel was great."
"Very nice hotel...close to WWI Museum which we visited. Parking garage was close and secure. Room service was very nice and staff were quite courteous. Great view from upper floor (we were on floor 34 I think). Bed was quite comfortable. Price was reasonable for a Kansas City hotel in the middle of everything. Fridge in the room which is great. No free WiFi which REALLY chaps me for as much as one pays for hotels now...but overall a nice stay."
"Intuitive and Friendly staff. Hotel was clean and well managed. Early check in was made available and each item on my profile was provided upon entering my room. The continental breakfasts were amazing!"
"Excellent place to stay for Hoopfest. It's a short walk to the downtown area. Friendly staff with excellent customer service. Free water and Gatorade for Hoopfest was a plus. Television reception was a little fuzzy at times. Clean and comfortable room."
"The staff went over and above to make sure our Volleyball team was well taken care of. Its a perfect location Downtown and walking distance to everything....Restaurants, Gonzaga, Convention Center and Park"
"The property was well maintained and staffed, the room was exemplary, the complementary breakfast was worthy and greatly appreciated. The location was ideal and my stay couldn't have been better. This will be my got-to hotel whenever I am in Spokane."
"Always a pleasure to stay here . Great service . Clean rooms . Great down town location . Enjoy the early breakfast . Really enjoy the bacon . check in is speedy and pleasant - like the evening warm cookies and milk . Enjoy my 4:30 am news paper"
"Excellent is the word that describes this hotel. Excellent staff excellent rooms, excellent service. IO would gladly stay in this hotel if the need came up. I would highly recommend it to you."
"Our stay was great. We had a very restful night and plan on staying again next month."
"Great Room. Big."
"VERY NICE HOTEL. HAD A NICE STAY. THE SWIMMING POOL WAS OLD AND NEEDED REFINISHING. STAFF WAS PLEASANT AND HELPFUL."
"Good clean room. The swimming pool is surrounded by the hotel (in the middle of the hotel), so people from the street can't see our activity Jose, the guy in the front desk was very helpful. He asked me do I have preference room, and I said no. So he gave me room on the first floor near the door.... More"
"I was surprised when I arrived at this hotel. The staff are all very nice and helpful. The hotel is easy to find and is very close to the downtown area and sports arenas. The hotel has a nice restaurant and a nice sports bar. My hotel room was clean and seemed to have been recently updated."
"A quick, overnight stay. This was our first experience with a Best Western and if they're all this good, we'll definitely look at Best Westerns in the future."
"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids."
"We were there for a youth wrestling tournament so we stayed for just 1 night. It was close to the events center, but it wasn't right in the downtown area where you'd have parking hassles. It was close to the interstate so we could easily get to other parts of the city."
"While in St. Louis for a medical visit, selected this Hampton Inn due to close proximity to Barnes Medical. Was upgraded to a suite at check-in. The room had a king bed, sofa, work area, refrigerator, and microwave. The room was comfortable, clean, quiet, and the hotel staff were very professional and pleasant. Breakfast was good and the eating area... More"
"Hotel was most accommodating for the time we spent in St. Louis. I would highly recommend the Hampton for anyone planning a medical or leisure stay in St. Louis. Only minutes from everywhere we needed to be, especially the local restaurants on the Hill."
"Hotel was very pleasant. Staff was extremely attentive, friendly and accommodating. Room was clean, cozy and comfortable. Very roomy....bathroom was clean and new, all soaps, cups, towels, etc were plentiful. I truly enjoyed the stay and would highly recommend this location for your next stay."
"Trip to Barnes Hospital required a few day stay at Hampton. Impressed with staff and quality of service/product delivered. Everyone was helpful from the front desk, room service and all staff. Nice place next door to eat also. Thank you, well done!"
"Stayed here while we were in in town seeing a show at the Fox. Short drive to the Fox and to the Galleria. Super close to Forest Park. Very clean hotel and friendly staff. Would definitely stay again!"
"No Hassles, No problems. Perfect Quality Hotel. Room was in great condition. Every Staff member was amazing and caring. From the breakfast staff to the front desk concierge. It is in a perfect location too. And Breakfast was of good quality."
"I have stayed at this hotel more than 15 times in the last 6 months, and I've had nothing but wonderful experiences. The staff is friendly and professional. Breakfast is delicious and offers much variety. The rooms are extremely clean and comfortable and the location is great! Free parking is a bonus!"
"This location is as good or better than the average Hampton Inn. Food is great. Room is great but doesn't have a fridge. The only negative is if you have a large vehicle due to the (free) parking garage on the property."
"We were delayed one day due to bad weather and the staff understood completely. This hotel is top quality in every way. The room and breakfast are both terrific. The breakfast included fresh fruit as well as usual favorites."
"I am away from my home several months at a time. When I stay in St. Louis the Hampton is my home, the staff my family. I always get a friendly, happy, warm greeting from everyone on the Staff. Stay and you won't go away unhappy."
"We will not be booking at this hotel ever again. We aren't looking for the best, but a little work and you wouldn't give off the roach motel vibe that you presently give to potential and former guests. Our room was ok, except that the phone had been ripped out of the wall so we were thankful we had our... More"
"Stayed one night while travel through. Closer to perfection: Hotel was clean, huge room, comfortable beds, temperature, breakfast. Even warm chocolate chip cookies at check-in. Price was low, budget price."
"I was very pleased with the service I was giving the rooms were very clean the bathrooms are very clean hotel in general very clean staff was very nice and helpful The beds were very comfortable very good Wi-Fi signal"
"This hotel puts Reading, PA back in the map. Great place to stay to celebrate, wedding, reunion, honeymoon, etc. Restaurant and Bar are excellent, breakfast is always scrumptious. The staff are very friendly, accomodating and knowledgeable. Lots of parking (garage).Thank you for the 5 star rating and review. We appreciate your comments. It was our pleasure having you as our guest."
"Best breakfast I have had at any hotel - marvelous fresh berries and navel oranges. Spacious walk in showers. Clean, large modern rooms and delightful management and staff. Attractive restaurant with an interesting selection of good food..Thank you for the 5 star rating and review. We appreciate you choosing to stay with us and the opportunity to serve you."
"What a fabulous hotel, this finished off our driving trip from las vegas to san fran to santa monica and i couldnt have booked a better hotel its modern, clean , efficient, just loved everything about it ! our room was comfy, bathroom big and shower fab we gained credits towards our bill by not having the room serviced whilst...

"We arrived pretty early, before normal check in. The front desk did not hesitate to try to find us a room as soon as possible. They even let us know that there was an upgrade available and would love to give it to us at no cost. (that is what i call service!!!) The room was beautiful, very comfortable, and... More"
"A huge thank you to Raul for such a wonderful experience by the bar and patio area yesterday! You were so attentive to us, and made the absolute BEST fruity drink for me. Your friendly smile and warm demeanor are so appreciated! Can't wait to go back and try another one of your fruity concoctions! :)"
"Very pleased with everything about the hotel. Great position overlooking Santa Monica pier. Staff friendly and helpful especially Tony who helped with our cases when we left. Only downside was the bedside lights going off if there is no movement in the room. If you get up in the night you have to fumble your way to the door to... More"
"Will be back. Staff was very friendly, flexible and generous. Vibe was Santa Monica with a Euro, modern flavor. Everyone on the team went above and beyond to both personalize and create a top notch experience."
"The staff were extremely friendly. Randall was very informative and helpful. The location is great, across the street from the Santa Monica pier. The room was quiet. The walls between bathroom and bedroom were see-thru glass. But there is a really cool privacy shade the lowers. It was clean and modern looking."
"I traveled 38 hours (2,592.3 miles) to this hotel. True indeed it is a nice hotel but management (Danielle or Daniella) is so unprofessional, inconsiderate, insensible, heartless, undiplomatic, shameless person. I booked my stay through expedia.com, expedia called to verify if i needed to book a day earlier due to my flight landing 12am which will cause my check in... More"
"We booked this hotel after a brief search on the web for three days at the beginning of a month long US trip. We were so delighted with it that we rebooked for our last 24 hours. We booked a King bed ocean view room and arrived after the long flight from Australia, the staff moved heaven and earth to... More"
"The location of Shore Hotel is great, right across from the ocean. I booked an ocean view room and we arrived a bit early and upon early check in, they offered us an ocean view suite at no extra charge since the room we had booked wasn't yet available. I thought that was great. When we got to our room,... More"
"What a great find right in the middle of all the action in Santa Monica ! I was only here for one night for work, but couldn't think of a better place for the money than here. Very eco-friendly, super-pleasant staff and clean, attractive accommodations. Pool area was great, there is a cantina restaurant very popular right on the property... More"
"I booked The Shore Hotel for a weekend stay after a Convention in Las Vegas. I found the hotel on Trip Advisor and after reading the very favorable reviews I decided to book it. When we arrived it was exactly how it looked on the website and right across the street from the beach. Upon check in our room as... More"
"My wife and I stayed her for 4 days and loved every minute of it. The staff was welcoming, and the rooms we clean, comfortable, and have 2 flat screen TVs. The rooms have 2 balcony with thick glass to prevent street noise and we slept so well. It is located in the heart of town, right on the water... More"
"We arrived late at night and were greeted by a terrific young woman who went out of her way to assist us. Her name is FELICIA. Felicia attended to every detail, was professional and made us feel as though we were family.....even greeted us with champagne. The rooms are great and you can't beat the location: right opposite Santa Monica... More"
"Everything about our stay was great. Traveling with 2 young children can be challenging but we felt welcome and comfortable at this hotel. The rooms were small but nice, the pool was fun for the kids and we were able to walk to the Pier and several restaurants. Overall, it was a great experience."
"Gorgeous contemporary hotel right across the street from Santa Monica Pier. Tons of shopping and restaurants within walking distance. Crazy bathroom showers that are completely surrounded by clear glass and open to the bedroom. Wierd and cool at the same time. But there is a button for the privacy curtain if preferred. Recommend staying on the 3rd floor or higher... More"
"Everyone including Ismael at this hotel went above and beyond to make our experience great. The hotel is a bit pricy but the location, service and comfort of the room made it worthwhile. Proximity to Santa Monica Pier, the Promenade shopping area, restaurants- All great too..."
"My family and I were here for a one night stay. Everyone from our check in, valet, bell desk to housekeeping made us feel welcome. We arrived at 200p and they rushed our room with housekeeping so we didn't have to wait. The room is beautiful, spacious and very clean. We were greeted by friendly employees everywhere making sure were... More"
"We arrived at 5pm as check in isn't until 4pm to be advised that Management had agreed to late check out on the ocean facing room we had booked and it wouldn't be available until after 7.30 pm (sunset was at 7pm). We were forced into accepting a side view room. Our plans of enjoying our ocean facing room sipping... More"
"We stayed at the Shore hotel two months ago, the hotel exceeded our expectations. We stayed in an Ocean-view Premier room which offered us a view of the pool and ocean. All was perfect, no complaints at all. The room was very clean and comfortable, the valet retrieved our car quickly each time and were very friendly. The staff at... More"
"Union organizers with megaphone reading union laws at 7 am! Due to the layout of the hotel it is amplified tenfold. Apparently there are no noise violations for doing this. Won't be back to Santa Monica better places to go that have better ordinances. Police just drive by like there is nothing going on."
"Great place to stay. Staff were friendly, new me buns me. Excellent breakfast. Rooms super clean. Wifi is lacking, my phone worked better on its own data vs. the hotel Internet. Will definitely stay there again."
"Perfect accommodations with friendly service at a great value. We are frequent guests at various Hilton Gardens and have never been disappointed. The whirlpool suites are worth the extra money. We also splurge on the breakfast package the omelets are wonderful."
"We came here for our anniversary and booked a spa suite, it took the water 15 minutes to get warm and once it was warm 10 minutes later you were blasted with cold water. We called down to the front desk to ask for more pillows because they fell flat as soon as your head hit them the employee at... More"
"very nice staff. clean comfortable room. excellent cook to order breakfast 10 buck extra but worth it. They also offer cooked to order diners."
"Hotel was filled with loud softball teams who ran up and down the hotel hallways until 1:30 am. Also, check your door when you leave your room. Our door did not shut completely and the outside exterior doors remained unlocked 24/7. This hotel needs better security."
"Everything was great!! We will definitely stay here the next time we come to Grove City!!"
"We stayed for two nights in room 323 and had a very pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel because it's clean the staff is very pleasant and the breakfast is great. If ever in the area again I would definitely stay here."
"Very nice property. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Only thing that could be changed is to have handicap spaces by all entrances"
"Love this place"
"My stay was great. The staff was friendly and welcoming and I even got a gift bag which made it a plus! I would recommend to anyone."
"We were trying to check in and even though they had our reservations, they had no rooms. The customer service agent went above and beyond to help us as there really was no room at the inn. They eventually were able to secure a room"
"Everything went very well. We requested early arrival and a first floor room. All requests were met. Personnel were friendly and most helpful."
"Great place to stay. I did a road trip with my significant other along the California coast. We started in San Francisco, spent the night in Monterey. Drove to San Simeon and stayed the night in Atascadero. A 45 minute drive from Hearst Castle. The hotel was great!! Clean and friendly staff. Great location, near the wineries and not a... More"
"Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME. Worst hotel I ever stayed at.. and I've stayed at some terrible hotels."
"I lived in Tallahassee for over 10 years and on a recent trip back to visit friends and family, I had the opportunity to stay at this wonderful Hotel! The room was booked by my church's administrator and so I was really concerned LOL,but I was so pleasantly surprised. When I read the reviews, I knew that I had to... More"
"Good no frills room. Quiet cheap and convienent location. I'll return."
"I travel 250-300 days a year. I've stayed in everything from The Four Seasons to Ritz Carltons to hovels in Pakistan with bullet holes in the walls. I once walked into a room in Maine that had a chalk outline of a murder victim still on the floor (Yeah. I checked right back out...) so I have no problem... More"
"I visited Lodi on a series of times but my experience at this motel was bad. A lot of noise. The Rooms were Ok but not severely clean. I wouldn't stay here again"
"I reserved this room on hotels.com for a quick trip to take my son to a doctors appointment. When i received my credit card statement I discovered that the hotel had also charged me. The hotel has not refunded me nor had hotels.com refunded me."
"Well maintained, quiet environment, comfortable bed, good wi-fi in room, good value."
"This is a great place to stay, particularly for the value. It would be nice if they offered a breakfast bar."
"When I first got in the room I didn't remove my jacket because it was so cold. The room takes forever to heat up. The blankets are very thin. They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it. Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did"
"Great hotel, restaurant and bar. Close to my work destination."
"Horrible. Never stay here. I would not have stayed if it wasn't non-refundable. Burn holes in the blankets, stains and tears all over the chair that was in the room to sit in, and I even slept in my clothes on top of the covers. Seriously disgusting. Never again."
"There are so many mixed reviews for this Inn. Perhaps we should post the room number when we write the reviews. I was in Room 102 with two beds. The sheets had old stains on them. There was a very musty odor to the room that was only made worse when the air conditioning was turned on. The door closed... More"
"Great customer service"
"Stay in the Blue Room. It was really cute. The Inn was located right in town so we were able to walk everywhere. The cutest little lady owns the place. We had stawberry shortcake for breakfast and spent the whole time at the beach. the price was very reasonable as well. The owner even let us borrow her beach chairs. We are coming back for their blueberry festival. it is supposed to be HUGE."
"We stayed at the hotel while visiting the USF campus. The double queen executive suite was very spacious and clean. All of the rooms face inward to the pool/ courtyard area, which was very nice. The hotel restaurant, Burger Theory, had some of the best burgers we have eaten in a long time, with very pleasant staff. The hotel offered... More"
"To say that the hotel was sub-par would be an understatment. The parking was good (though it was a really hard turn off from the road). The front desk staff was mostly friendly (one of the ladies in particularly was amazing). When we were going to our room we had to go through the pool area. The pool was alright... More"
"If there is one piece of travel advice I feel most strongly about it would be GO TO ORCAS ISLAND!!. It's one of the most spectacular places I've ever seen! And if you're going to go...stay at Rosario. It's old, it's historic, it's sort of iconic. We LOVED every thing about it. The people staying on boats in the marina... More"
"We stayed here one night, but enjoyed it very much as it is close to the state park and very well kept. We would go back for sure. They were very nice and accommodating. Wonderful stay in all for our family of three. It would be nice for more dining options to be nearby as those are currently limited by... More"
"Enjoyed the beds and pillows. Very comfortable and slept very well. Multiple update work going on so look forward to an even better experience next visit. Wireless worked very well, my son played online MMO game with no complaints."
"There is a state of emergency declared for the south-west portion of Virginia and reports of bridges being washed away in Radford. When I inquired whether I could cancel my reservation on the day of due to the inclement weather and not wanting to make the trip I was told that I would be charged the full rate of the... More"
"Just look at the photos no others words are necessary ... This is in Radford VA, don't know how this place went down hill from a year ago. Moving in a college student in all day, getting to the hotel to this ..."
"We were checked in by Elizabeth at the courtyard in Oakland. She was very friendly, professional, helpful and efficient. Elizabeth is the kind of person I want working for me. She represented the Marriott brand superbly! This is the hotel I stay at whenever I am traveling from Oakland airport. I love the pool area the courtyard area and the... More"
"We stayed at Celina Motel for three nights. It is a very nice little motel located less than 4 blocks from the lake and right on the edge of town. The rooms were nice and clean the beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom was large for a motel bathroom. We were very pleased with our stay and will definately... More"
"It was the worst experience. We booked from hotels.com but the motel employee did not update the status of the room and we got the room didnot have hot water for shower.w hen we call to front desk they said they knew it and still they have us the room. No responsibility at all."
"comfortable and hospitable...would definitely stay here again....a great value!"
"There were dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom and carpet. There was dog fur or some sort of animal fur on the furniture. There was a cigarette burn on the sheets. The room smelled like mold. The comforter smelled bad. I didn't see any bed bugs but I was paranoid about it all night. The bed was lumpy and felt like it was going to tip off of the platform. I could not believe I paid 100 to stay in this room for a night, but everything was sold out."
"We stayed here for 4 nights over Thanksgiving. Our family had one of the suites that sleep five, and it was nice and spacious. You can tell the hotel is pretty new. Everything was in good working order. The room layout could have been slightly improved, as you really can't see the TV from the sofa. The bed linens were... More"
"I accidentally booked this hotel when I meant to stay downtown...oops. But it turned out to be a really nice accident! This hotel is extremely well run, from top to bottom. The staff is friendly, check in super easy, and the hotel is very clean and nicely appointed. (we also just happened to have arrived the day after they had... More"
"My husband and I had a single room booked for three nights with all sorts of confirmation numbers. When we arrived on Friday July 19th to check in we were told that there were no single rooms available, and they were too small for us any way He also said hat he'd give us a deal on a double. The... More"
"Clean room , pleasant helpful staff. Very convenient location. Comfortable beds and free parking. Very good VFM for such a central location. If you decide to stay here then do not miss the Urth Cafe just along main Street."
"Is it swanky No. Is it clean Yes! Tile floors throughout mean no gross carpets. Bathrooms all have nice, clean tiles throughout. Comfy beds with different pillows means you have choices. New windows block a lot of sound. We stayed in a downstairs unit but either the upstairs folk weighed less than 100 pounds or the place was built when... More"
"I loved this little motel. At first we picked it just for the location and price. Turned out to have very friendly service, and clean rooms. It's not a 5 star, but if you are a thrifty traveller you will like it. The pier and Venice Beach were just a 10 minute walk away. Main St. has lots of cute... More"
"This hotel was wonderfully located within walking distance to many restaurants, beach and shopping. It was immaculate and had free parking and WIFI. The front desk was very helpful giving us a general layout of the area when we checked in. There was an Italian gourmet type deli attached that served amazing breakfasts and lunches and a food truck gathering... More"
"We stayed in this quaint motel for 4 nights while in Santa Monica. Prior to arrival we were tossed between staying here for 2 nights and then going to Hollywood for 2 nights. I was so happy we stayed! What a wonderful place. The staff very friendly and helpful, a big shout out to Tom who was so very helpful... More"
"This is a very economical motel, great location, great service, clean (although floors could have been a little cleaner but it's tiles with sandy environment so ....), and free parking. Close to many restaurants and pubs, and beach. I would def stay here again for the price point (if you are not looking for a fancy hotel type)"
"All employees were super friendly and accommodating, the rooms are clean, and overall an excellent experience! Would recommend highly. Good value as well. One of the nicer hotels in Anderson. Close to the casino.Thank you so much for your lovely feedback, hope to see you soon."
"I came to Chicago a couple days before I could check into my convention hotel. I found this place on Groupon Getaways and it did NOT disappoint! While I spent most of my days sight seeing, the amenities went a long way in helping me get my morning started. I loved being able to use the wifi while sipping coffee... More"
"Our son works in the area and decided to stay near his work rather then where he lives. EVERYONE at this Best Western was VERY pleasant. Every employee would always welcome us with either a hello or good afternoon. GREAT Stay and the Cinnamon rolls were awesome."
"I really enjoyed the friendly staff and the room were very stylish and my wife feel in love with the bathroom we had the 2 bedroom suite and it was fantastic . We really look forward to spending a nice romantic stay in the next couple of weeks"
"This place is awesome. this wasn't my first time here and its even better now. The place looks brand new, futuristic like. The room was super clean and smelled great. I didn't want to leave the room. And to top it off the service was excellent. Especially the manager, i think his name was Byron, super helpful and knowledgeable. But... More"
"Staff was friendly. However, they charged my debit card 3 times then when I actually got there to check in they took my credit card and charged it once. Breakfast was okay. Mostly carbs. TV didn't work at first until the next day someone came to fix it. No ironing board in the room. Was kinda noisy outside with other... More"
"Rude man at check in, no cable or internet for 1 1/2 days, dirty sheets, staff not helpful, no coffee, horrible stay!!"
"Room 11. One queen and a double. Place was clean and the beds are comfortable. I have a brand new Stearns and Foster and I slept just as good here as at home. No amenities but I just wanted a bed for on the way to Pagosa Springs."
"The Green Tree Inn in Elsah, Il. is the perfect place to relax and unwind from the hustle of every day life. The town (village) itself is enchanting with it's quaint, historic, homes, and the people who live there couldn't be friendlier. Definitely a place to visit and enjoy. Our accommodations at the Green Tree Bed and Breakfast were first-class.... More"
"Elsah is charming. The inn is a very short walk from the river and a view of the bluffs. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. The inn keeper gave us coupons for wine at the Grafton Winery and Restaurant where we enjoyed the sunset over the Mississippi. Breakfast was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed another night!"
"This was the fifth time that we've stayed at this BB and it was just as charming as the first. Connie and Gary are such gracious hosts! There is always plenty to eat at breakfast (someone at our table had three servings of Connie's pumpkin pancakes--and it wasn't me!) and I just love the afternoon treats that are prepared from... More"
"This hotel is absolute garbage. From the quality of the rooms to the entire staff,absolutely nothing held up to standards you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Good luck if you want to actually make it to the airport on time, their shuttle service was a complete joke."
"The room there are very nice, and I will be glad to return there again for a visit . The motel customer service was excellent,and very nice people make you feel at home At all time. The comodation was absolutely incredible. Thanks Ramada Inn."
"Park and fly was good. Staff recommend a great place to eat. Shower head not working well. Need to update mattress."
"We booked this hotel for one night following a wedding shower in the Kansas City area. Because of multiple sporting events in KC, there were virtually no hotel rooms to be found in KC on this particular weekend. We were lucky to find a vacancy at this hotel in Paola, which turned out to be a wonderful place to sleep... More"
"Rooms clean, digital check-in upon arrival was less than 60 seconds. Worth the time saving and convenience. Room was clean ad set up conveniently for comfort. This was my second experience with digital check-in and found it convenient and easy"
"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our visit to Virginia last year. Check in was easy, front desk staff was friendly and helpful and spot on with their recommended spots to eat. Indoor pool was a plus being from south florida we need a pool. This hotel was such that as we planned our winter vacation for 2016,... More"
"Everyone at this hotel was top notch. Very friendly, personable, accommodating and helpful. The suite was more than expected and pleasantly satisfying. The only thing I'd improve on is the lighting in the room."
"You really don't need to leave this hotel between check-in and check-out, except of course we did. My initial reaction is that it's one of the quietest places we've ever stayed. Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Checking in and out were pleasant experiences. Staff are pleasant. Our room was beautifully furnished, bed very comfortable, bathroom nicely appointed and spacious.... More"
"We came to this hotel to relax and sit in the hot tub. We get there and find out they had taken out the hot tub. The young kids ran up down the hall all night long and nothing was done about it. You can't tell me that in a small hotel like this one, the front desk didn't... More"
"Only had to change rooms once( no a/c) Here is a few other issues no tv ,wifi broken bathroom door, dripping water, toilet running. Employees were nice They told me I would get a good discount if I stayed. Still waiting!"
"We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had."
"I was happy considering I used to live in Flint and I'm wary about the hotels there. Everything was clean and in good condition. Shower was hot and staff was nice. Area is very convenient."
"The room was not clean and smelled of smoke. We did not stay and they would not refund us as we were told that we paid online and could not be refunded."
"I was traveling to the coast to take an exam at Cuesta and didn't want to pay a lot, but wanted to be safe. I was at the college in less than 10 minutes the next morning. I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I got in late and they went out of their way to make... More"
"We came to Warner Robins with our team for the State Wrestling Tournament and enjoyed our weekend trip due to this lovely place! Machonda was very sweet and gave us directions to the nearest ATM. The room was nice and I love that we were given the option of fluffy or firm pillows!!"
"I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place. The guy did not understand what I was saying then responded with we charge already before he rudely hung up on me. I needed to book in Thomson Ga and not Thomaston.Sir Sorry You late call and we busy all most full and I hold room. Thanks Sam"
"I was hesitant about booking this room but only needed a hotel for one night before heading to Panama City Beach but got a good price so decided to go ahead and stay here and we ended up being very pleased the rooms were very clean and spacious had a wonderful siting area and a nice pool that the kids... More"
"THIS place was and absolute DUMP ! ! ! They are in the middle of renovating and they tried to put me in a room that had not been renovated yet. EVERYTHING AND EVERYPLACE you look the place is FILTHY ! ! ! Motel 6 would even be a better place to stay than this place ! ! ! !... More"
"Everything about this hotel was excellent! Check-in and check-out were super fast and easy (I use the mobile app). Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. I LOVED the shuttle driver, Yacob. The complimentary shuttle is a great service. Breakfast was standard but good. The room was spacious and the layout was nice. The location of the hotel... More"
"The staff are great! Very nice people , clean rooms, and a very plentiful kitchen stalked with food. The front desk is small but the people are most gracious. They offer immediate help and hospitality. I highly recommend them. I stayed in room 311 and had a great stay! Very good motel! Extremely nice to children of all ages! (... More"
"Quality Inn's service is the best of all the hotels i had stayed in my last trip. Location wise hotel was well placed next to the freeway, Hotel Rooms are very spacious. Breakfast spread is basic. Hotel has ample parking."
"Stayed there with the kids (6 of us total). Room was spacious and pull out couch was wonderful. Nice kitchen type area with frig and sink. Would choose again."
"My trip to San Antonio couldn't have gone better! The hotel staff was super friendly, room was nice and free breakfast was great. (Plus hotel is really close to Six Flags!) I would definitely book here again."
"The staff was courteous and attentive to us The room was nice, had a privacy wall and was big enough for a family of four."
"I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting San Antonio! The room was so spacious and comfortable to be in. Large living area with comfortable couch and big tv. Breakfast was great with plenty of options to choose from. The front desk staff and maintenance/cleaning people were so friendly and kind. My husband and I were very pleased with our stay! Thank you!"
"We only stayed one night, but everything was great. Very nice room. I was nursing a leg injury and they were kind enough to accommodate my request for a room with an accessible bathroom."
"Nice hotel with a lovely pool. Near to Newport Beach. It is on a busy intersection and is hard to get in and out of. Otherwise the rooms are quiet and clean. The restaurant is pleasant but the service was slow even though they were not busy. Easy access to John Wayne Airport."
"Checked out a day and a half early due to bed bugs. No other vacancies there, but I don't think I would accept another room there anyway."
"I generally use lowest cost accommodations, so often use Motel 6. They tend to range from OK to a great deal. This one is absolutely the WORST one I have ever used. I had the impression that it is about to fall apart and someone is milking the last few dollars from a decaying structure. When I walked down the... More"
"Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel. Perhaps it was the bathroom, urine smell that greeted you as you entered the lobby the 1970s carpets,... More"
"This hotel was good in all respects. The only complaint I can think of was the heating system in the room was a little too noisy. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. The breakfast was great, and the room was very comfortable. No complaints other than the one I first mentioned. You will like staying here."
"Check in was fantastic! The rooms were clean. They have a fantastic pool for kids, which was great since we have a two year old. It was close to most of the major attractions. They had a variety of breakfast items to choose from. We will definitely stay again!"
"Room was ready upon check-in and hotel room was very big! Nice clean room with comfortable bed. After a long day of scuba diving it was wonderful to go and relax in the hot tub. Breakfast wasn't very good though. Pool food quality and not very good selections."
"The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned."
"Not pleasant at all. Loud noises and voices after midnight. Parking lot and stairs in a very bad condition. People who checked me in and out seem to be too busy and in a bad mood."
"Worst place I've ever stayed. Toilet leaked, shower faucet was broken. So noisy, was like sleeping on the highway. Beds old and not comfortable. Weird people lurking around. I just can't even explain how terrible it was except to say I recommend t they just bulldoze the whole thing."
"The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home."
"I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund."
"We stopped in here for a night's stay due to the fact they had a vacancy. We had already been in the area for 2 nights but our hotel was already booked when we wanted to extend our stay! We stopped in the office to check the rate for the night and the gentleman who I think is the owner... More"
"We traveled to Tarpon Springs for two reasons: three business meetings and a dear friend's 75th birthday celebration. The hotel staff members were very nice and helpful. The hotel was lovely and clean, and our room was comfortable and accomodating. The free hot breakfast was an unexpected bonus! Quality Inn Tarpon Springs is certainly a budget-friendly, conveniently-located hotel, and it totally exceeded our expectations! We will definitely consider staying there for future business and personal trips to Tarpon."
"My wife and I were hoping for clean and found it to be extremely well kept. The gentleman that checked us in was very friendly as well. Located in a great location to visit the local bars and restaurants. We would stay again."
"We come to the Dells every summer. We look to stay places downtown off the beaten path of the resorts. Indian Trail was excellent! Pool and grilling area were great. My husband and I loved playing shuffleboard and badminton on property with the kids. There was a nice wooded area to walk around in evening. Also the morning of our... More"
"My husband and I planned a last minute trip and chose this motel based on reviews. It was a favorite! The room, including bathroom was very clean.

More"
"Everyone went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable."
"A clean and well kept place with a friendly staff. Easy on off from I-77 Good breakfast close to restaurants and next door to a gas station. A better Quality Inn would surely stay again. Neal Ellen E"

"we had a nice room, The front desk was very courteous, recommending a restaurant and giving directions to locations we were going the next. The breakfast was very good. We did not use the pool. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
"Very nice hotel in a good location. Staff was pleasant and welcoming. I was Hilton's guest of the day which was a pleasant surprise! I love Hampton Inns and find them to be a great value. Breakfast is an additional bonus."
"Stayed here on an April Saturday night. Check-in was easy. Lobby was spotless and front desk staff were courteous, friendly and fast. My room was very large even by Hampton standards. The hotel looks fairly new so everything was in tip top shape. The next morning, a housekeeper greeted me in the hall and asked how my stay was and... More"
"Reviews on Tripadvisor were very good for this place and the price was quite low . . . so we thought we would take a chance on it. We stayed here on the Sunday Night before Memorial Day 2016, after being in Vegas the prior night and being at crowded Zion National Park and less crowded Cedar Breaks National Monument... More"
"We were heading to Canada at the beginning of August and couldn't find anywhere to stay. We have been driving already for 11hrs and it was almost midnight when we found this motel.

"the BWSkyline Motor Lodge is a very relaxing place to stay the staff are alway very friendly and will help in anyway they can. the lobby is always welcoming. the rooms are clean and comfortable. i would recommend the BW Skyline Motel to anyone"
"I arrived in town with several motel choices. I called the owner and he was wonderful, He gave a great price for a fantastic room. I loved the town as well. Lots to see and do including fossil hunting. Great people too. A wonderful visit!"
"Very clean hotel but staff from the minute checked in just felt like they had better things to do with their time and really would rather be somewhere else. We would ask them questions and they either ignored us or their person conversations were more important. Will not be staying there again."
"Great stay! Comfortable beds, staff were friendly and helpful. The pool and hot tub were nice too."
"When I first arrived at this motel I did not realize what I was getting my self into the first night was ok no major problems no more than to be expected from a motel right next to a bar. Although after the time I had to live there 2 months I found out that the sewer backs up into... More"
"Just dreadful, and scary. Was traveling alone with my dog. We were so tired, just needed somewhere to rest. What a filthy room, and the door did not shut tightly, you could see light through it...which wasn't too huge a problem until I was awoken in the middle of the night to loud party or something, which quickly turned into... More"
"Woke up to many red, itchy bites all over my body. I'm so disgusted. Front counter guy was very rude noisy children laughing talking in the middle of the night. Stayed in room 223 in the bed closest to the window, so If you have to stay here-- make sure it's not in that room."
"...without the hassle of being downtown. Nestled in San Marco one block from Hendricks Ave., this cozy little hideaway is well worth looking for. The hotel is just far enough away from the traffic, yet so close to everything if you're willing to be creative. For instance, if you want to head to downtown Jacksonville and the Northbank Riverwalk, you... More"
"As always, extremely satisfied with my stay at Hilton Hotels, great quality and customer service! The price is afforable, well worth it for the luxury and quality of the hotel and amenities. I will recommend this Hotel to anyone."

"This motel is clean, quiet, has A/C, flatscreen TV/cable, and well lit parking. It also has free wi-fi... Which I am using right now. Best of all, for a non-special Sunday night, we paid 58 for 2 adults, 2 children. Decor Style Who cares.... The bed and room are comfortable."
"Totally disgusting!! Room smelled of mold. Flushed the toilet and water leaked all over the floor. Went to the desk and the jerks handed me a towel and a bucket to catch the leaks!! Then they charged us twice but my bank cancelled the second charge. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING THERE!"
"The property is very nice and well cared for on a daily basis. Complimentary breakfast very good. Staff very friendly. They are rated by AAA. Property to walk around. Restaurants close by with good food. Pool and hot tub. The only problem that I had is that I used a pre paid travel card for the room. They put a... More"
"Grand Haven Michigan is one of those places that has remained great over time. It combines history with the present for those in for business or leisure. The Beacon Inn enhances this experience by providing clean updated lodging with extras available if desired. The staff is happy and around. There's a great computer if one doesn't want to set up...

"Hampton Inn is the best hotel we've ever visited. The beds are so comfortable. The complimentary breakfast is delicious (and includes protein foods). The hotel staff is obviously carefully chosen and well trained. They were all very friendly and helpful. We felt so welcome. I would highly recommend the Hampton Inn to everyone."
"This was a nice stop for the first night of our vacation. The hotel is easy to get to off I-77 and we found the hotel to be very clean. We were impressed with the layout of the rooms, which more modern than most hotels. The price for the night was a great value and breakfast was very good with... More"
"The room was a nice size and very well decorated. The bathroom was very nice and well lite and easy to put my makeup on. The bed was comfortable and my husband got a good night sleep.

"My husband and I stayed with the Tass family for a week in August 2012. The Tass family allowed us into their lives to see how their ranch operates and to enjoy beautiful scenery from their horses. If you want a guest ranch where you get to be part of the family and without strict schedules, choose this one! There... More"
"We were very happy with the quality and cleanliness of the hotel. When shelling out money for a hotel these are important things for me. Yet, I don't want to pay high end prices to get them. This hotel had met these things at the right price."
"Difficult to find with few signs and not visible from the road."
"Everything was very good, but pool looked bigger in the pictures and controlling the room temperature to be comfortable."
"Quick stay but the room and breakfast were a welcomed surprise, nice shopping area in the vicinity, but we had other plans."
"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!"
"Our trip was for business. We found the staff to be very helpful. We would stay there again."
"My girlfriend and I drove down to Vienna to visit a sorority sister for the weekend. Loved the Residence Inn. The room was clean, the breakfast was great, and every staff member we encountered was friendly and pleasant. From the check in to the check out and the girl hustling when there was a breakfast rush on Sunday - she... More"
"Very friendly staff. Room provided ultimate comfort for relaxation."
"good"
"Nice cute place to stay for a while. Loved it!"
"Had a Bad experience here. Bugs were crawling up the Curtains and the Cieling. I killed a few and housekeeping didn't even clean the mess. Aweful. I should have take pics."
"Staff was courteous and room was very clean. Watch out for the 1.50 insurance charge for the room safe. Never seen that one before and did not like that I had to request at checkout that it be removed rather than at check in."
"We love everything about this place. The location, the history, the unique flora and fauna, funky cool building, great owners (Scott and Cathryn) are like your favorite aunt and uncle. The floors creak, the bathroom is down the hall, the doors stick....these are just more things we love about it! Talk about character, this place has it. If you love... More"
"Sad to say we took my sister in law and her family there on Mother's day and got the worst service in history. We got in and told to sit in a corner, and obliged. It tookthirty minutes before the server to bring water with no menus. Then when asked it took her another 15 minutes to retrieve those. After... More"
"Great dining, great amenities, comfy room I was super happy with my experience and I'll definitely be back, if not for personal travel then definitely for work events. Very much looking forward to returning."
"My family moved to Freehold in 1967. We still have friends and favorite eating spots (Federici's) in the area. Had to travel to nearby for a family birthday party and took advantage of the hotel proximity for some nostalgic exploration. What a great find! Nice front desk greeting, clean and well-appointed room and on-site bar. Very clean, very modern. One... More"
"This was a return trip back here and we were still very pleased with our stay. Check in was quick and easy. Our room was well appointed and immaculate. My only complaint was out sleep number bed, which was pretty much like sleeping on some rocks. To adjust it, a horribly loud noise came out. But I understand they are... More"
"Hotel check in is fast and easy.. Rooms are clean and very consistent.. we did room service for breakfast and the food was hot and on time.. Check out was even easier, just left key in room. The staff is friendly and very accommodating which makes for a relaxing, stress free stay. We have stayed here many times(+10) and it... More"
"This was an excellent place to stay when I was visiting my son and his family that lives close by. We stayed for nearly a week and so we took a suite, which turned out to be a great choice for us. The little kitchen was perfect for our needs and the small sitting area provided us with a bit... More"
"It was an amazing stay. The hotel, staff and facility was amazing. I was here for a wedding and everything was excellent. We checked in early. We we were treated very well. The staff was very attentive. I see. Recommend."
"Always delightful. Professional and convenient"
"I had pleasure of dealing with the most professional, sweetest, person in the hotel industry. It was very stressful time with planning son's wedding, arranging for rooms and breakfast the next day --- Deanna took all anxiety, fears, and took the bull by the horns and made everything one of the most beautiful days of my life. I have been... More"
"terrible terrible..... a guard was rude and nasty. Worst hotel stay of my life, and on my daughter's wedding."
"Deanna Ricioppo the Room Sales rep took the time to search for the reservations we needed. She return phone calls and answered emails the same day. We called a few hotels for a 2 month short stay and Deanna was clearly the best. We booked it with Deanna and would recommend her to all our family friends. Andy S...Manalapan... More"
"My dad recently stayed at the Radisson Hotel in Freehold and was extremely pleased with the level of service. The front desk was extraordinarily helpful to him and the room was extremely clean and the bed was a Sleep Number bed - which he was raving about. He comes to Freehold to visit several times a year and will make... More"
"The room had a very comfortable bed and a nice rain shower. The room was the perfect size and not too cramped. The fitness center was very nice. It had a lot of hand weights which is rare for a hotel gym. The food/drinks from the restaurant were great. The hotel overall is very clean and very convenient to shopping... More"
"This hotel was fabulous. The staff is very much customer service centric. They made my stay better. The rooms are nice and WiFi reliable. They offered great places to visit and eat while there. This hotel is not pricey and HIGHLY recommended."
"The Cedars Motel has what you need to vacation in St. Ignace. It is a CLEAN motel to rest your head at the end of a day of sightseeing. Tim Kathy were a great help with explaining the area attractions and how to get there, and any construction that may delay you. The kids loved sitting by the fire... More"
"We have been here several times, once when the current owners had just purchased it. They went out of their way to make us comfortable then. This year we returned to many renovations making it the cleanest place we have been in. They have maintained the history and charm of this old building. We call Augusta the last frontier for... More"
"This is not Augusta, GA, this is definitely Augusta, MONTANA! Maybe 300 people, 3 bars, and one gas station and a spectacular view of the Rocky Mountains! The rooms are efficient, all you need, clean and the decor takes you back in time. For a very old hotel with two spotless share bathrooms at a very reasonable price, this place... More"
"Loved this condo property. Nice amenities unit was very clean and spacious. Would certainly recommend especially for families with kids"
"Exceptional stay. Was only 1 night, but nice little hidden gem here. It's actually condo setup that requires lock box code from office. Easy check in, fully kitchen was very nice pool awesome. Very nice stay overall!"
"Took family for quick getaway. Got great last minute deal on this property. Kids really enjoyed the grounds and clubhouse was nice touch. Unit was very clean overall we really enjoyed ourselves. We would certainly recommend to anyone interested. Thanks again!"
"First off they way over charged me. Beds were terrible had cigarette burns in the comforter. Entry ways to rooms smelt terrible. Stains and trash on the floor. Safe was not functional. Toilet was stained. There was mold on the window drapes. Emergency exit would not shut or lock. Cigarette butts all over the ground out side of the room. Pool was not functional. Trash on room patios. There was a Bullet hole in a window."
"It was so dark and deserted looking when we drove up we thought it was closed up. I booked online and they couldn't find my reservation. I should have walked away but it was 1:30am, we had been to a concert and there were no rooms in Milwaukee due to Summerfest. The room was so dirty we left our shoes... More"
"Fighting outside the room dirty room mold room TV only had two working channel I won't come back better experience first time"
"The hotel clerk checked someone else into our room and we were awoken in terror at 1 am by someone attemping to enter our room (their key opened the door but we had the slide lock closed). Never had a problem with Microtel in the past, but this was so far beyond unacceptable that we'll never stay at one again."
"Rates are reasonable and service is good, I have been staying at Micro hotel in Henrietta and Victor N Y. At different times for few years and will continue to do so in the future."
"We booked this hotel not really knowing what to expect with all the mixed reviews. We were pleasantly surprised. We booked the Jnr Suite with two queen beds and a kitchenette in the middle. Small toiletries items are provided, but you'll need to provide your own dish soap. The room is very large and you don't feel like you are... More"
"The hotel was nicer than I thought .Also a good location to the area I was visiting on my trip.Enjoyed their continental breakfast ,they had lot of variety of foods ."
"Second time in a row that we have had an awful experience with the hotel booked through your website. Your website gave the hotel 3.2 stare. I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches."
"The chilis down the road is a little wait but the food and service is amazing. Nightlife is a drive but it's nice to park your car at one and walk I drive. The beds are a little hard but still got a good nights sleep."
"My stay was very pleasant and jackie and maggie make my stay better.Ty girls!!"
"We spent 4th of July weekend with family and friends at the Little Creel. The new owners were very friendly and helpful. They made it a point to check on us often and made sure everything was going ok! We had an amazing weekend there!"
"Lovely Motel on the lake - and in the evening we came back to find the fire-pit was a blaze - so we sat and watched the sunset over the lake and drank a few beers - perfect! The room was nice enough. A bit small - but fine for the night. The town of Speculator is a lovely little... More"
"We were quite late getting to the hotel. Reception was really great. Most importantly, we were traveling with a dog and the hotel is pet-friendly. Breakfast was fine."
"Spent the night after hiking McAfee Knob. The hotel was clean, the staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a step above the usual continental breakfast. The location was excellent if you are there for the Blue Ridge Mountains and want easy access to the highway in the morning."
"This was the second LaQuinta we stayed at it was very nice. We would stay there anytime. Because we have a dog it makes it even nicer because most hotels that allow pets are not that clean."
"While the dcor (lobby/breakfast area) may seem a bit different....don't let that put you off. They have a Great variety of Breakfast foods. It is a great hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Check in and check out was easy is typical for La Quinta's."
"no breakfast on time or donuts from the frige, no Service, no place for garbage, water in bathtub don't run away, durty floor etc.etc. a horrible experience!!! we are from Germany and our american English is not as good to write more Details."

"This is a family owned operation. The owners themselves see to your needs. Dan Jenson even helped us carry our luggage to the room when we arrived. We stayed in the Penthouse, which was phenomenal. The pictures on line do not do it justice. At first, I was hesitant to go to a place that does not have room service,... More"
"If you are looking for a comfortable beach front location, it does not get much better than this. You would have to rent a private home to find anything comparable on Captiva.

"Hotel was easy to find. I could see the top of Mt Rainier out our window. Room was clean and comfortable.

"When I checked in for my stay, the clerk could not even be bothered to get up out of her chair to do my paperwork. My room did not even have a shower curtain on my first night. The Super 8 was better."
"We had a 2 night stay. The room was immaculate and comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding, many choices and home cooked options that were delicious. The staff were helpful and took pride in their place. Would definitely stay here again...great location, too. A great find."
"This is an older property which reminded me of the ski lodges that you see in movies. The views were wonderful filled with fall leaves. The lobby had a fireplace and comfortable, cushy furniture. Wine and cheese was available in the lobby in the late afternoon. The rooms were spacious, and had all the amenities. Though not new, they were... More"
"We will stay here again. The rooms are clean and the breakfast was good. If you are in the area, you should stay here.The manager and staff are excellent. This the 3rd time we been there. We had our pet with us."
"Fullerton is a small community 10 or more miles from the nearest town in any direction. There's not much to do or see here, the roads aren't paved and you could probably fit the entire town into one photo shot. But in the midst of this tiny town, one structure, the Carroll House, seemingly displaced, catches your eye and keeps... More"

Thank you for the fantastic review and we hope have you back again soon."
"This hotel met all my standards: First foremost, it was clean. Secondly, the bed was comfortable. Shower looked new and had some nice features, in addition to having a modern shower head. Along that line, the room entire hotel was modern/refurbished. Good wifi reception."
"The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, and the property well maintained, but it was the friendly, warm-hearted proprietor who made this place special. I would recommend this motel as not only a good value but as a place with an unusually pleasant atmosphere. In addition, we were delighted to find that the Lasalle Big Blue Stem Trail was... More"
"Room was huge, continental breakfast in the morning, good location close to airport, friendly staff - everything great, except the bed bugs. Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker - woke up with about 30 bites on hands, legs neck. Hopefully you won't get the same room. If the bugs were gone, my quality value ratings would be high!"
"We stayed for one night after coming to and leaving from Alaska. Although they claim to have non smoking rooms, some of their rooms have been used for smoking before. Both times, we were given rooms that was smelly. The first time, we were given another room that was good but the sink was not draining properly. Since we were... More"
"We really enjoyed the hospitality at this hotel. We were picked up promptly from the airport at 1 am when our flight arrived and also given a ride to the train station at the end of our stay. The room was spacious and the staff was very helpful."
"The room was very clean and neat and the continental breakfast was good. Our 1Am shuttle driver was very helpful, courteous and loved the music and chat. Could change the courtesy desk height-way to tall."
"Dreadful place to stay. Beyond belief that they can charge such an exorbitant rate for such inferior accommodation. We arrived late after an exhausting journey and just needed some sleep. Some hope. Dirty room, did not want to walk round without shoes on. Could not bring ourselves to sit on the sofa. Curtains were hanging off the tracks so barely... More"
"We arrived for our first family vacation only to find out they lost our reservation. I had the print out of our hotel confirmation but that made no difference. Staff was friendly but not helpful in finding us new accomodations."
"Be afraid be VERY afraid.I'd rather sleep on the ground then thisresort.Upon ariving two young boys came to the unit to collect a 45 cleaning fee.They brought a vacaum cleaner with them to do the floor around me as I signed the paperwork. There were dirty cups in the sink which my wife washed.There were crackers on the floor behind... More"

"I would advice not to go for this hotel. The staff is higly rude and they will over charge u. Very un proffessional behaviour will keep u waited un ncessary."
"The man at check desk was rude and yelled at me. The door was poorly hung, therefore you could see light, the bathroom fan was so loud you could not shower with the light on, there was a very thin and hole filled blanket on the bed, there was no coffee pot or microwave as promised, the fridge froze the contents, the carpet was gross on bare feet, and there were no hand towels only a wash cloth and bath towels. Was robbed by this stay. WAY more money than it was worth!!!!!"
"Horrible, the beds were like bricks and lacked comfort."
"The first time we went on vacation here we walked into our room and just started laughing. You get what you pay for. And here you are paying for location! What amazing views. He's the rooms are not the best but they work and we love it. It has become our special place together. We try to get away once... More"

"The Hampton Inn on S. Lumpkin Rd., in Columbus, Georgia is a beautiful hotel. It is very close to the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center. The rooms were very nice, very clean. The breakfast is your typical free breakfast at most hotels, but the staff were friendly and the breakfast room inviting and clean. The only thing I found... More"

"There is no finer staff I have found in my stays in hotels. Perfect location for attending an Army Graduation. Clean,Clean Clean room. The only flaw is there is no place to eat lunch or dinner on site. Columbus GA is a bit complex to drive about if you are new to the area"

"Actual adjustable showerhead, great water pressure, BLANKETS(I know one reviewer didn't have any on their bed), stocked bathroom, tv worked fine and so did the fridge and microwave. The staff was very friendly to us, despite a mixup from the website not informing them of my room change. Maybe ours was better because it was a 2 room I don't... More"
"Arriving at this hotel we had an open mind, this surely changed within the next hour of our stay. We checked in at roughly 10 PM, this process took a drooling 15 minutes at least. The two staff members had a hard time finding my reservation that was booked 3 days before through Hotels.com. We finally received our key, drove... More"
"Worst hotel experience of my lift. We are campers who do not require amenities and state of the art anything. BUT we do expect clean. There was black mold under the window sill in room 204 which was exposed by the peeling wallpaper. Not sure if the hotel owns a vacuum. The bed underskirt was dirty. Lamp broken. Shower rod... More"

"Cannot say enough good about this place! The addition of the peddle boats and paddle boards really seal the deal that this is the best place on Canada Street! Something for the kids poolside everyday, movies and popcorn and snow cones. This is our second year and I am certain there will be many more to come!"
"I had issues with every hotel I stayed at this week. Plus the traffic in Springfield stinks. I picked this hotel because it was in a small town not far from my first stop the next day. Room was fine it was quiet bed comfortable. Breakfast was ok. I'll stay here when I have to work the... More"

"The staff was very friendly, especially Housekeeping. The breakfast offered a lot of variety. The hotel amenities were great. Good value for the price."
"Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless."
"Great Experience considering the horrible weather we were having. The staff was exceptionally nice and friendly. Breakfast was very good and the location in all was very clean."
"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting."
"The two days I spent at your Best Western Inn near the Rochester airport, was great before and after my sons graduation ceremony from RIT college. The breakfast every morning was delicious and definitely worth getting up early for. I really enjoyed my stay at this location."
"I travel a lot for business and picked this hotel to try out and the price was right.Had clean rooms ,most important was the high speed wifi and it worked great. The staff was friendly and helpful.Planning to come back for vacation with family.I highly recommend this place for your trip."

"I have become a very loyal customer of Best Western in the last 2 years. This stay before and after my cruise the hotel just proved that I have not wasted my loyalty. Everything was clean, staff was friendly, pool was wonderful, etc... This is why I stay Best Western. They haven't let me down yet."
"This was a top tier Best Western Hotel. It is close to the airport and cruise terminal and offer free shuttle to and form the aid port and for a nominal fee to and from the Cruise terminal. Every thing was in working order and their free breakfast was as good as any free breakfast I have had at any... More"
"In a word - awful. Called early in the day to ask for a late check in lady was very sassy and snarky rather than just making a note on the reservation. Once actually checked in: room extremely tiny, AC unit very loud, bed uncomfortable. Housekeeping knocked at 8am to clean room - checkout wasn't until 10am..."
"worst hotel ever. do not stay here."
"The only reason I rated the condition a little low is because there was a loose screw in the bathroom threshold that could hurt someones bare foot."
"we would give this location a 5 star rating and would Recommend. Was more than I expected. Beds were good, and everything was clean and neat. The exterior was also clean and neat. Everyone on the staff seemed happy."
"MIXED FEELING ABOUT THIS MOTEL Travel up to Billings MT on Sunday 1/24/16 and made reservation through choice. At that time reserved the room with choice points in the amount if 12,000 choice points. Ok I'm fine with that as long as they have semi parking.

"This family-run lodge exceeded any and all expectations we had from the moment we arrived. The stunning grounds located off a flowing river and surrounded by trees were matched only by the tremendous warmth and generosity of the people running the resort. It's hard to a imagine a more perfect place for a group retreat or a family getaway."
"We stayed in the Turkey Run two bottom cabins, perfect for the two families (4 adults and 3 children). Lots to do, a short walk to the Black River, so much fun hunting bugs and crawdads, floating, swimming. We played games, mini golf, mini zip line, a tree house, the kids loved it. And the adults enjoyed the excellent food... More"
"This was a very nice experience. The food and service were excellent! The owners are extremely nice and helpful. The kids loved the play areas and the recreation center. 1st time visit and we will be back and next time we will try the float trip!"
"First of all, I'll warn you that there are no refunds, no exceptions. Power went out and a guy who just purchased a room 5 mins prior was denied a refund when we were all informed it could be up to two days before it was turned back on. The owners of this hotel are an Indian family, and I... More"
"Stuck in area for 2 weeks and needed cheap place to stay. My family video camera was stolen out of my locked room while we were out for the day. All of my video of my children growing up over the past 12 years gone because some piece of human trash figured they could get a few for a... More"

"I was impressed as soon as I walked in the lobby. It was neat, clean, interesting and nicely decorated. Also, just walking down the hall to your room. It zig zags a bit but its so much nicer than walking down a straight hall of doors. Likewise, room large spacious, 2 queen beds, separate living area with a pull... More"
"Got a great Name your price deal on this hotel. The staff was great (and funny!). It was about 8 miles from downtown, but it worked for us. Breakfast was very good, although they ran out of coffee at times. Very clean rooms and very comfortable. Would definitely stay again."
"Nice location in a newer area (Eastside of Naples, just off I-75) that was quiet and surprisingly clean and comfortable. I felt the 3 star rating was below the value we received. Cordial staff, very clean and complimentary breakfast was real food! Nice."
"Staff was very friendly and went out of way to answer question about surrounding area. Our room was very clean and accommodating. Free breakfast was one of the best we have had. While we were eating we saw someone straightening and cleaning area 3 times. Everything was great. Would stay here again if ever in the area."
"Free room on BW points, regular stopping hotel on trips tpo SW Missouri. I find Best Westerns the best value for the price and always use them if available for both business and personal travel. I have never had a bad experience in any Best Western in 23 years and a business traveler."
"The carpet was filthy,tub didn't drain,area around the breeze ways is very trashy, they give you 2 towels for 2 beds and refuse to give more no matter how long you are there, refuse to refund monies if you want to go to different hotel, the swimming pool looks like a cess pool. Walls were nasty, I just really can't... More"
"We drove up to Sedona in the wee hours of the night. Awoke to the beautiful scenery! This hotel is clean and well taken care of. The continental breakfast isn't mind blowing but has the basics. For the price and convenience, it can't be beat."
"This place is great! The service is incredibly friendly and welcoming. The free breakfast is delicious and on weekdays they have fresh baked cookies in the evenings. I come back anytime I'm in Ashland."
"The staff here was wonderful! Got us thru a rough time due to a funeral for a loved one coupled with the worst snow storm in the area in years!

"The front desk was most accommodating and welcoming. Maddie (if I remember correctly) was top-notch in giving us directions, answering questions, and overall just making us feel welcome after a long drive."
"The hotel had excellent lighting both inside and outside. I felt very safe entering the hotel at night. The hotel was well decorated, the room was very clean and the staff was courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend this facility."
"Smile and help at every turn. Clean, Comfortable, Great Breakfast, but the staff was the gem of this stay! Thought I had a reservation,DIDN'T! The staff bent over backward to get a room then check other hotels for my reservation so I could cancel and not get charged. Had a problem with the TV, staff was right there in minutes... More"
"I stayed here for 1 night and discovered bed bugs in the morning. My back was covered in bites and there were multiple bugs under my pillow. I immediately raised the issue to the front desk and they could not be less concerned about the bugs. They informed me that theyve had issues with bed bugs in the past and... More"
"I understand these cabins are 75 years old so I didn't expect to walk into a 5 star facility but I did expect it to be clean, even somewhat clean would have been nice. The shower had not been cleaned AT ALL, the commode was not flushed, one bed had hair in it, the other bed had dirt in it,... More"
"The staff are entirely accomidating . The hotel itself is clean and quiet . I love the fact that they had a full size fridge and that they went out of their way to make accommodations for my dog would dtay again."
"Checked in and checked right back out has no hot water and had roaches crawling on the bed would not ever stay there the people there are very rude and very nasty and the manger lady pick up the roach bare handed and tossed it out Side and then wipe her nose with that same hand"
"great service"
"The staff here was really great - courteous, helpful, well-informed. The room was comfortable and the kitchenette a real boon. Great value for money. If we're in the area we'd stay there again. Breakfast was nice enough, though a bit more variety would have been nice."
"dirty room"
"Had 3 rooms for our group. One door wouldn't hardly lock. Had strong animal smell. We stayed 5 nights and they did not clean our room once. Definately would not recommend this hotel. Worse hotel I have ever stayed in."
"If you decide to book this hotel you will be disappointed."
"As a guest I was very impressed on how the front desk Clerk handled being in a situation dealing with a deaf guest! Even though it was hard to understand my husband, Stasia did a great job in making us feel welcomed and comfortable."
"We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1."
"it was terrible.it was dirty.the bathroom was not clean."
"I stayed in this hotel with many of my family members due to a wedding we were attending nearby. Room was spacious and felt really clean. Diana at the front desk worked that weekend and was beyond accommodating. We all (about 7-8 rooms) had requested early check-ins and she worked her magic in making it happen due to the time... More"
"This Hampton Inn is one of the friendliest hotels. It is clean, well run, and centrally located. In particular, Diana at the front desk was exceptional! She is always smiling, and willing to help in any way. We always stay at this hotel when visiting Tampa Bay Downs, and would highly recommend it."
"We got a great deal on a Queen Suite for an overnight stay during a wedding we attended in Clearwater. Suite was spacious and clean and could have easily fit six of us. Staff was friendly and location was conveniently located to some shops and restaurants. And about a ten minute drive to a really nice mall."
"Very cute and extremely clean motel. I rented a single and it was decently sized with a TV w/cable. Shower stall in my room, 133, was a bit small but great water pressure. Convenient location to the artsy things in South Congress but also an easy 1+ mile walk to 6th St. It was quiet. Full-sized bed was very comfy.... More"
"The lodging options in this small town are limited but frankly, this hotel works very well. It's clean, well located and has a very friendly staff. The bed was comfortable and had great pillows. What more do you need"
"Always good service and perfect ambiance"
"Never had a bad experience with this hotel. The staff is not only professional, but fun to interact with. Hot tub was very enjoyable, as was the pool. A good variety of restaurants are available in the area. A great place to use as a stopover for further travel going South."
"This motel is dated and extremely dirty. Everything about this place makes me want to RUN away as far as possible. The carpeted floors were very dirty and were NOT vacuumed. You could see fingernail clippings and food particles, just to name a few. There was a dirty towel and someone's sock right behind the dresser--this will let you know... More"
"I book a room every year at this time for the Rendezvous usually at the Brisbois Motel.Oh my, I said no way. After trying hotel after hotel, we came here. I was very upset and the lady at the front desk said everything will be fine. She got us in , then was waiting to see if we was going... More"
"This was really a nice hotel property and would stay there again. Rooms were very clean and the property was well kept. The breakfast was good. It was quiet. The hotel staff was very helpful and the Internet was free. We stayed using a senior citizen rate and thought the rate was very reasonable compared to other motels in town."
"The rooms were great. There is a great kitchen with the needed amenities. The bed was comfortable and the room was a good size. The breakfast was good but having one person was not enough. Sometimes we had to wait 20 minutes to eat because the food ran out. There were a lot of people trying to eat. Overall, it... More"
"I have never had such a horrible hotel experience! I booked straight through their website, not a travel website. The room I booked was a 2 bedroom suite that clearly stated it has a king and 2 double beds. We arrived late after a long day at Busch Gardens on the day after Christmas. Check in took awhile but that... More"
"The website pictures of the hotel are very deceitful and does not match the actual product when one stays in the room. The pictures are misleading. The staff was rude and indifferent. The room we stayed in was smelly, dirty and poorly cleaned. The buffet breakfast was terrible and was done on a very low budget, they put out some... More"
"Our stay was excellent, it was very comfortable and we enjoyed it. The Staff was very friendly and nice. The Hotel was very clean - the breakfast was good. I would stay there again the next time I go to Albuquerque."

"I love where this Hotel is located. It is right next to the Capital Building. It has a nice gym and a nice clean swimming pool indoors.

Dining staff was extremely friendly, made our son feel special and so happy. The... More"
"This was the absolute worse stay at a motel I have ever experienced. We told the owners that we were looking to stay between one and two months. We were shown an efficiency down back....kitchen, living room and bathroom. Everything was agreeable until the owner realized I needed a nurse to come in twice a week for one hour. The... More"
"Great location, friendly staff. Nice room. Breakfast OK. Wish the eggs were real instead of powdered. Suite was good for working. Shopping close by. Easy access to major highways. Highly recommend staying at this hotel."
"We went to this Hampton in Brownsburg Indiana for a family night getaway. It is right iff the interstate and a short drive to downtown Indianapolis. The pool was very warm which made the kids and parents happy! The hot breakfast was very good and the hotel was very quiet for being sold out. The beds were so comfortable that... More"
"There were a lot of people staying there during my stay but the hotel was quiet at night. The couch was getting a little worn and the air conditioning was quiet. The internet worked good. It was an easy trip into Speedway."
"Great hotel in Rochester. Its well located right next to Costco, near the city center so if you visit the Mayo clinic you can not go wrong with this hotel.

"Rude desk person, smelly room. Initially, I politely asked to change rooms because of a funny smell. Instead of being polite and understanding, the desk person asked why I had not brought this to their attention last night and told me I could not switch rooms. She finally offered to let us switch rooms after looking at the room herself.... More"
"On a recent road trip, we stayed at several hotels - mostly Best Westerns. This one was by far the best of them all. The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and fresh and the breakfast area had the most variety. They had lots of fruit, which was hard to come by in the other hotels. Everything was... More"
"Where do I begin I can't express how well we were treated from the moment we entered until the minute we left. 1 The smell of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies as we entered the lobby at check-in! 2 The smile, wave, and welcome from the laundry room help as we passed on our way to the elevator to get... More"
"Awkward and inefficient front desk staff. Worst check in I've experienced. Hotel is dirty and room smelt like a wet dog. Fire alarm cords hanging from ceiling (with no alarm) and plastic cup secured over fire sprinkler."
"With a group to tell others about the love of Jesus Christ! Sleep well and great breakfast!"
"This was a horrible stay. The hotel was run down and dirty. We were not able to get to our reserved king room because supposedly the battery in the door was going bad and couldn't get in after going back to the office 3times. We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again. When we told them we were unhappy with a room with a double bed, we were told you wont be able to do anything since you didn't go through them directly (since we booked through hotels.com)"
"My stay at this hotel was the most enjoyable stay I have had this year. The staff and the hotel were first rate. And I felt the rate charged was a great value. I would by all means, stay here again. And I would recommend this Best Western to others."
"Surprised by the quality of this hotel-very clean well furnished rooms , professional and friendly staff-no complaints. It was very quiet and convenient. Very central location from which to visit Mt. Dora and other destinations."
"We stayed here after a long day of travel. I booked through a 3rd party on my phone, then went out to dinner in Savannah, drove the distance to Kingland, and checked in late. So, we checked in late after a very long day of travel. Because we were checking in that late, I actually called to make sure they... More"
"This hotel badly needs updating. The first room the faucet didn't work, the room they moved us to you couldn't open the door, the next room had two double beds instead of a king which I had reserved. I was very disappointed in this Comfort Suites! We usually have good luck with Comfort Suites but not this one. Wouldn't stay... More"

Check in was very fast and the staff was very friendly. We had a king suite for the night that was very clean and spacious. The beds were very comfortable and clean. We were... More"
"We are Choice Hotel platinum members, and we've discovered that many of the Comfort Suite properties are comparable in price to the original hotel rooms, but larger and with more amenities. This one is definitely in that category, and we did not find a problem with cleanliness like a few others did.. Like other reviewers we had trouble finding it... More"
"We were driving from Florida to North Carolina and thought that we would stop half way. I am glad we did, this is a very nice hotel to stay in. There are 3 of us and we each had our own bed and breakfast the next morning was great. The only thing we had an issue with was the parking... More"

Very comfortable beds, air conditioning, satellite TV, free wifi, ample parking, kitchenettes, restaurant/bar nearby, perfect for the 2 months we stay every year!"
"We stayed at the Golden West last summer, and returned again for our son's OIT orientation day.

"We took a 3 week driving tour of the West and national parks. I wish they had a Sunshine Inn in every town. That said, this place is not for everyone since it's not hip or updated. It's just cheap, clean, and the bed was the most comfortable of the trip. We saved 100 here over what we had to... More"
"Stayed 1 night and found this gem perfect for our needs. The owner/ manager was friendly and accommodating. I've gave me his coffee mug when I told him I was a styrofoam cup snob. ( I hate drinking hot coffee from styrofoam.) No hair dryer in the rooms, but just ask the manager and he'll get one for you. If... More"
"I have stayed at several places for both business and pleasure over the last 12 months and this was one of the very top stays. I was VERY surprised that a small town had a place of the stature. I was staying for my Granddaughter's wedding but will be back very soon. It was GREAT."

"We arrived a bit early to town for a wedding and stopped at the hotel just to see if by chance we could get an early check-in.

"This is the hotel if you're just needing a place to stay in Traverse City and do not need lake front property. Rooms were clean and comfortable. WIFI included and a complimentary shuttle which is great if you're trying to get around town to visit the breweries. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and inviting. I will definitely stay here again if I visit Traverse City."

We had a mini fridge, a microwave, coffee maker, and a flat screen TV with a DVD player. The bathroom was spotless!! I'm a bit... More"
"This motel should not be listed as an option. The rooms smell dank and the bathroom has a lot of black mold the carpet is torn, the curtains hang by a thread. It's a place good only for the drunkards and other destitute residents who live there semi-permanently. It's a disgrace."
"The other review was obviously written by one of the owners. Grossest room I have ever been in. Only good thing I can say is they were nice enough to refund my mY money so I could go somewhere else. I am writing this from the Super 8 few blocks away and I can still smell the stench of the... More"
"Great stay, quiet, and affordable. West Texas is famous for its hospitality and this place contributes mightily to that reputation. I especially liked the outdoor fire pit and sitting areas. I look forward to coming back."
"We are laying down for our third and final night here in Room 11. These are the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! The room is clean, AC is good and chilly, and the deep soaker tub is heaven! We've enjoyed the courtyard/charcoal grill. Getting to watch our kids play on a vintage metal merry-go-round has been so cool.... More"

"Recently spent 2 months at MyPlace in Pasco WA. Newly built hotel it looked like, so everything in the room was new and clean. The room was serviced every 4 days as advertised and the maids always did a good job. The receptionists up front were all nice young girls."
"Every Labor Day my husband and I try and make it back down to Lavallette to spend the last unofficial weekend of the summer. Our stay was once again comfortable and relaxing. The Lamplight is located just a block off the beach and nearby shops and restaurants are easily accessible by either walking or a short drive Each morning we... More"
"our motel that we booked for the week made a mistake and could not give us the room. We went to lamplight motel and they helped us out .if it wasn't for lamplight we would have to go home.Nice rooms and staff .thank you again"
"I have stayed at this facility, once or twice a year, going on some 30 years now. I travel by motorcycle - rain, shine, cold, and warm. The personnel I have interacted with are always first rate, helpful, and friendly. The facilities are clean, dry, and in my opinion, complete with everything I have wanted/needed/expected. The takeout facilities Sunset Motel... More"
"Our stay at this Wingate was exceptional! We were greeted with a warm, friendly staff. As a bonus, we received a goody bag of munchies and a water, upon check-in, which was a pleasant surprise."
"I stayed at the Wingate in Erie, PA this past weekend. Everything was great, the staff was friendly, the hotel was clean, beds and pillows were comfy, breakfast was yummy. I would highly recommend this hotel."
"Rooms were cleanwell supplied. Bedding was awesome! Staff helpfulpleasent! Breakfast was the best surprise of all! Fantastic!"
"Really enjoyed the stay. Great breakfast to get the day started, then out for the day, came back after dinner, then went in the pool and hot tub to relax and wrap up the day."
"Hotel is very easy to get to. Rooms were excellent as we were there for a shopping trip. Breakfast is a bit crowded on Sunday as most guests are leaving on the buses,other than that no problems"
"I have never stayed at a hotel as dirty as this. The sheets in the windows were ripped, the drain in the shower wouldn't drain, and the mattress was as lumpy as I've ever slept on. The freeway noise was like the trucks were going through your room!"
"We stayed here while visiting family visiting the wine festival. The hotel was clean the staff was very friendly. Even house keeping was great. The 2 negatives, some people were getting welcome bags, while others weren't. There were some people complaining in the elevator about this as we were going to our room. It didn't matter to us,...

"The room smelled terrible of smoke even though it said no smoke hotel. There were ashes on the floor! And drunk men wandering around outside! The the hallways had trash in them. It was dirty and unclean!"
"very peaceful and not from restaurant's and highway. very clean and staff was very pleasant"
"Bed were made poorly, cigarette ashes in bathroom floor. Over all a sloppy sleepless stay."
"Room smelled like cigarette smoke. Bunch of guys from another room having a party, being rowdy and getting drunk in parking lot right near office until 3AM. Clerk did nothing to quiet them down, call the police, etc. I was a little concerned when door to office locked at night and saw a sign for weekly rates. I will no longer stay in motels with outside doors. Accommodations would not have been terrible but I guess when room is too cheap, maybe doesn't attract best crowd."
"Booked 2 rooms during family trip. Got there late, felt very unsafe, room dirty, had to put towel over desk chair because it was gross. Stayed at other Red Roof locations and when I bring up this location they say they've heard about this location. Yelling, noise, smokey smell rooms (though supposed to been smoke free) but if you saw... More"
"My stay was last minute as I did not feel like driving back to Columbus, I was welcomed at the front desk by Patty, she has been with the hotel for30 years (that says Allot about Red Roof inn as a company) it was her birthday, but she made me feel like it was mine...such a sweet welcome...offered me bottle water....and all I expected was a bed. THANKS PATTY!!YOU ARE AWESOME!! Happy birthday again!!!"
"It the worse motel in Baton Rouge LA.it has bedbugs don't rent from them the rooms are nasty rotten mattresses in them the owner gets rude when you tell her about it the health board should be notified cause there is black mold in rm 5 along with bedbugs"
"Disgusting. Poorly kept rooms and grounds. Repairs are as cheap as possible. Unless you have no choice, I would go somewhere else...in a hurry!! Know around town to be housing many unsavory guests. Dirty, no good, a waste of money. Even for a single night. The first night I stayed, my dog found a piece of a crack pipe. She... More"
"My wife and I had a dual interview in Lakeland in the early morning and this was a pleasant stay in a clean room with all new amenities. Everything about the hotel was nice and clean, the area was easy to get to and the surrounding neighborhood seemed safe."
"Nice check in and out fast. The pool area, like the frosted glass but if more than three double rooms go to the pool it exceeds its capacity. I never like this in new hotel due size but that's part the flag standards. The hallways smell like nasty feet, no so much the rooms. Breakfast was to standards and knowing... More"

"This hotel was dirty, and it was a MOTEL, not a hotel as described. We tried to cancel after checking in, we were booked for a four night stay (through Expedia) but could only get half our money back. I'm surprised Ramada would put their name on this hotel at all. Staff was not professional (wore sweatpants), and there is... More"
"The manager and the other people who worked at Ramada Flagstaff were very nice and helpful. The room was very clean and comfortable and they have a great deal from Papa John's which came in very handy since we were exhausted from a long trip and didn't want to go out for dinner. Would definitely stay there again and want... More"

"Nestled in Cooks forest, it's a clean, charming and Rustic Lodge. BEAUTIFUL natural wood. The restaurant is amazing! The quality of the food ( breakfast and lunch) prepared to perfection. I love the quietness and the lovely 4pm warm tea and fresh out of the oven cookies and muffins. It was a nice added touch! The only thing I would... More"
"Just spent last weekend of October at Gateway in Cooks Forest and really liked it. First, the setting is lovely....fall in Cooks Forest is the time to go. We could smell the woodsmoke as soon as we entered the lodge, dusk was falling, and little chipmunks scurried across a bank of rocks illuminated by the lodge lamps. Get there before... More"
"We truly enjoyed the forest atmosphere around the lodge. The room was great and the comfort level was excellent. It was very quiet in the lodge and there was lots of gathering places to read, or just relax. The morning breakfasts were outstanding. The staff went out of their way to accomodate my dietary needs. We will return."
"My husband and I stayed here this past weekend for a romantic getaway. All the staff were helpful and friendly and the food was wonderful. It was cool at night so the fires in the fireplaces were welcome and we loved having our own private fireplace in our room. We will try to get back there again."
"The room was clean and well appointed. Good breakfast, and most importantly the front desk people are friendly and helpful. Very hospitable! They were very willing to help with restaurant suggestions and information about the area."

"This was a great experience! The staff is amazing.They were always wiling to help, friendly and professional. The breakfast staff was eager to help meet all dietary needs. The rooms were clean and attended to regularly. Parking was plentiful and the hotels proximity to local amenities is convenient."
"This place should be closed. It is dirty and un-safe. Upon check-in, the woman at the desk said she required credit card or cash payment up front (should of been our first clue this place a disaster) She would not hold payment until our check-out like other hotels. When we got to our room, what we found was outrageous. The... More"
"We stopped in Elko for the night on April 2 on the way to Reno. The place is not fancy, but the room was clean, decent sized and the beds were comfy. Bathroom was good. Shower worked well. Quiet.

"I haven't had any previous experience with Hampton Inn but after reading the reviews I thought I would book my stay. I was NOT DISAPPOINTED. The Hotel was WONDERFUL and I have absolutely NO complaints.

"A friend had made reservations to this hotel that I knew nothing about getting there from the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport is a long but interesting drive being that it was my first time as an adult visiting Georgia. From the outside I thought boy this place is going to be average but when I went in I was so pleased... More"
"Hotel keys are required to lift the gate to the parking area which was a nice feature. Very close to Cumberland Mall and tons of restaurants and shops. The young man working the front desk when we checked out at was extremely friendly and helpful. Most hotel employees don't seem sincere but he did. My only complaint is that we... More"
"Great location and good services...Hampton Inn provides an excellent service to its guest, hopefully my Hilton Honors will provide discounts to other properties I plan to vacation during the coming year."
"Clean, comfortable hotel with friendly and helpful staff!"
"Service is good, room is clean"
"Traveling for work in independence Iowa. Weather forecast was not good. Decided to stay overnight. Lady at desk told me areas to go in case of tornado. Also reviewed sirens, as well as local restaurants. Very professional and informative. I highly recommend staying here!"
"We/I have been staying at the Baymont several times month for a week at a time since 2013 The front desk staff are ALWAYS friendly and helpful, my room is clean and stocked. If there are ever any problems, they are addressed immediately. It makes me feel like Im an owner, not just passing through. Thanks!"
"We had a great stay at this hotel very near Walt Disney World! The property and guest room were very neat and clean. The furnishings were attractive and the beds comfortable! The breakfast buffet had many choruses including eggs and sausage and the staff was very attentive by refilling items and keeping the tables clean. We would definitely stay here... More"
"This place is horrible. Dirty inside and out. Don't stay here, you will regret. The best part was that they refunded me! The photos are of 2 separate rooms. I pulled back the blanket at the end of the bed and found this! The rooms were dark and dated. Even the exterior was dirty. Trash littering the stair wells. Many... More"
"It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!"
"This was the dirtiest and worst run hotel we've ever stayed in. It was so dirty we had to leave early and find alternative accommodation. Sticky carpets, dirty linen AC and fridge not working. Changed rooms but no improvement - no way could this be a 3 star hotel"
"roomy, great price, very helpful front desk close to all disney parks. they only serve continental breakfast. they have fridge, coffee maker microwave in the room. this is really in kissimmee area between the street markers of 5 6. very near to good restaurants supermarkets."

More"
"It's hard to find an affordable nice place to stay in this area. The price was great and so was our room. The only thing I'd change would be trays to take breakfast to your room because there was no where to sit. That's minor though."
"I booked this room by Hotwire.com and thought I was going to have a TERRIBLE experence because of how much I paid. HOW WRONG I WAS! The check-in process was seemless, the lobby was extremely clean, and the employees were all plesent and helpful. The rooms are large and clean. To top it all off they provide a continental breakfast!... More"
"This is the second time I have stayed here. The rooms are large and we had two double beds in ours. I did not use the pool but there were people in it all the time. we had to call down for towels and an extra blanket."
"Very good place to stay"
"I was completely satisfied with my stay. The continental breakfast was more than I expected. The beds were very comfortable and so were the pillows. Beautiful room, great tv and accessories. It was great!"
"I stayed here recently while visiting family who live about 30 minutes away. What I liked about this property is that it was very clean and offered free wifi. Also its locations is very convenient if you plan on using the highway to go back and forth to Ft. Benning. Would definitely stay again!"
"The rooms were clean, neat, and its surpisingly quiet.( Because its located just near the Interstate)..Not a good selection of Breakfast though....."
"The hotel was suggested by family members that we visited in Columbus. we agree that the comfort and value were well worth the selection for our stay. if we should schedule a longer stay, such as a vacation we would surley have no problem requesting to stay at a Microtel again."
"I was pleasantly surprised. Stayed 7 nights. Staff was friendly and accommodating. I wish I had gotten their names to send them a commendation. The unit was clean and well supplied. We had no neighbors or either side so we had lots of privacy. The common areas were clean and well maintained. I know some reviewers have complained about the... More"
"Nice kitchen full size ref and ice maker, I'll be back. Only draw back is once you pull out of property to main street you must turn right and go down and make U-turn or cut through another property to head toward DW"
"So my fianc an i stayed at the hotel the night the front desk gentlemen was super nice an friendly next morning breakfast was awesome. The room was very clean an if you want to take a hot shower. Best hot shower ever. Would definitely be going there again."
"There was one issue after the other. We noticed immediately upon entering our room that there was no toilet seat. Traveling with 3 females need toilet seat. Went to front desk to be told their were no other rooms available. A few hours later a toilet seat was brought to the room, at which time we discovered it didn't... More"

"The beds were worn out and rolled to the middle, every time you moved the bed made noise. The tub was old and discolored. The towels were ruff and smaller. Breakfast was a surprise and decent. It had hot waffles, but there was not fruit available. The street getting to this hotel had huge pot holes that could not be... More"

"Best room we have ever had...large, modern, modern bath area, large fridge, good wifi, good lighting, nice breakfast. Plenty of shopping restaurants across the highway. Close to airport. I would recommend this motel for anyone. Probably best value for the money that we've had."
"Our 2nd stay at this hotel. Everything was great and we will be staying there again on our next trip. The facility is nice and so is the staff. Beds are comfortable and nice breakfast in the morn. The computers in the lobby made it easy for us to print out airline boarding passes."
"This hotel is in a very convenient location. Only 15 minutes to Tulip Town and Roozengaarde. Everything in the Skagit Valley was easy to get to yet still not a lot of congestion in the hotel area. The included breakfast was pretty good but not great. Best of all, in my opinion, was that our room was very, very clean.... More"
"Staff was great. Room was large, clean, quiet and comfortable. Breakfast was the best I have experienced at any Best Western Plus. The hotel is centrally located and close to many restaurants and downtown area."

Good breakfast, including boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, sausages, and make-it-yourself waffles. Staff were very pleasant and attentive. Plenty of free parking. Indoor pool looked appealing although I didn't use it. Several restaurants and wine-tasting rooms within walking distance. Free... More"

"My bridesmaids booked this hotel for my post Bachelorette Party Shenanigans lodging. It was VERY comfortable, clean, and spacious. I felt so spoiled that they booked such a nice room for me. I wish I had pictures to post."
"Our group met in the Portico Room for a several hour business meeting. From organization, set up, lunch, and friendliness of the staff, it could not have been a better experience. They were very accommodating to the multiple requests from our group and it was quite apparent that they pride themselves on service and guest satisfaction. Our meeting attendees that... More"

"I always seem to have a great time at Le Meridien. I generally stay on the club level floor and it is always good. The attendants in the lounge during breakfast are always great. Brenda goes above and beyond every time I stay there. She even remembers my name and is just very pleasant. This time a young lady names... More"
"My husband and I stayed here as a last minute weekend getaway and we couldn't be more pleased. I'm not a fan of Atlanta, however, this area is great. The hotel is directly across the street from the Perimeter Mall (walking distance). The check-in and out process was easy, all the staff were very friendly. There was some sort of... More"
"I'm a local and have been coming since the resort was built, but on our visit last weekend things dove to a new low. Never mind that we spent over 70 so that two kids could play for less than 2 hours, and we could attend to them (10.50 per person to just watch your kids). First, we had to... More"
"This resort is beautiful and ideal for a family vacation. We visited with my parents, my sister and her family and my kids. We rented a 4 bedroom villa, which was perfect for all of us and had plenty of space. The water park is fun for all ages. The area looks fantastic, but we didn't explore much because of... More"
"We needed a room last minute and this resort was reasonably priced. Was hesitant because it's so kid-centric, but they won me over. Staff was great and they put my husband and I in a room on the conference side - away from the water park. The view of the lake was fantastic. The grounds are well kept. Walking distance... More"
"We chose the Blue Harbor because it's a half way point for our family to come together, and so the trip commenced with 3 families piling into a 4 bedroom (unit 730) villa. With 11 people you would think it would be crowded...but not even close. From a fully stocked kitchen with everything you needed to cook large meals, to... More"
"I visited this location in October 2015 as this was our state conference site. I stayed in room 340, which is a King Suite City-View room. Check in was very quick and professionally handled (they had 3 employees at the guest services desk). Very spacious room, has microwave, mini-refrigerator, patio with chairs--could easily fit a family in this room. Everything... More"
"Stayed at Blue Harbor because my spouse had a work meeting there this weekend. We thoroughly enjoyed the bright and clean rooms. All the staff was friendly and accommodating. We did not require much, but even as we passed them in the hallway, everyone said, hello and/or held doors for us and were generally pleasant and professional. All went out... More"
"This year we decided to rent a 4-bedroom villa for Thanksgiving Day instead of having our get-together at our parents' house, which can get crowded. There were 15 of us in total. We swam at the waterpark in the afternoon (wristbands included in villa rental) and then went back to the condo for our evening meal and game night. The... More"
"We live only an hour from this resort so it's one of our go to places for a long weekend. We prefer the loft suite - two double beds downstairs with a full bath, tv area, fireplace and balcony and another bed upstairs with a half bath. The suites are always clean and housekeeping is prompt and courteous. The water... More"
"Room was dirty, black hairs and grass on bathroom floor, tub liner was disgusting, old tube style TV and only had 1 washer and 1 dryer. I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area."
"Stayed here to finish my last week of work before preparing to move to Las Vegas! Very comfortable, great staff, housekeepers were awesome!"
"We arrived in town at 10am, and asked if we could check in early. We realized we were very early, but hoped we could check in before 3pm. We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever."
"We stayed here one night (9-14) prior to my spouse having a medical procedure done in Southaven, as it was a 1 1/2 hour drive from home and the stay made life much easier. The hotel parking lot was clean and well-lit, as we arrived after dark. When we entered the lobby, it smelled very clean and looked nice as... More"
"My experience was not as a motel guest it was as a stranded female biker in need. I was overwhelmingly blessed with an amazing, genuine, and truly warm welcome and ready assistance. Kathy Kile and her daughter instantly came to my aid! A regular customer even offered me a ride to Harrisonburg (67 miles away!). HOG Roadside Assistance was unable... More"

"If you have traveled down long straight roads for hours and hours and are in need of some rest and comfort with a touch of elegance this is the place for you. Not only is this small family owned motel in pristine condition, but the couple that run it give it an extra special something. As part of a road... More"
"The staff was courteous, the hotel was right off the highway and close to good dining options, as well as a gas station, but quiet. The neighbourhood is decent and pleasant to walk around. The waterslide is fantastic, and there were several good and hot breakfast options. They were mindful of our online requests, though I made reservations far in... More"
"Our stay was excellent! I don't normally give high scores but the hotel and staff were top-notch. Our room was clean and cool. Any time we needed to ask a staff member a question the staff member smiled and was generous in giving information of where things were in the City of Salina and Abilene. I rate the hotel overall a five."
"I have stayed at this particular location multiple times over the last several years and have always been happy with the courteous and professional staff. Breakfast is always fresh, tasty and a very good selection of items. The room, lobby, and breakfast areas have always been clean and presentable. Thanks to the staff for the hard work...very much appreciated!"
"We made our third overnight stop at this hotel in 2015 and once again were very pleasured with it. The rooms have been very clean, the staff welcoming and attentive, and the breakfast better than most continental breakfasts."
"We planned a last minute 4th of July trip and was lucky enough to snatch up a cancellation at the Crooked Hook Resort. Chuck and Sharon were extremely helpful. They answered questions over the phone, through email, and assisted us practically all hours of the day while we were there. I could have easily spent half of my vacation hanging... More"

"Excellent customer service and the rooms are exceptionally clean. Would not think about staying anywhere else. The free breakfast every morning is great with a variety of options. Quick drive to the Redmond Airport and the shuttle service is very helpful."
"We have stayed at this hotel about once a year for the past several years. It is always just as advertised. We only need a place to shower and sleep. The staff is polite and professional, the rooms always clean. The room had a tv, fridge, microwave, coffee pot and they offer breakfast. For the price we paid, it was... More"
"Stayed for 2 night with 2 dogs, really clean hotel for being pet friendly the staff was really friendly. Also GREAT Steakhouse next door - very convenient. No complaints at all."
"It may look a bit dated as seen from the road and most of the the rooms we have stayed in are on the small side, but the utilization of space and attention to detail is amazing. Breakfast is the basic typical fare, very relaxed in the bright cheerful lobby area."
"This an older motel, but kept in great condition by the owners. Very clean and quiet. Park the motorcycle right outside your room. Reasonalble rates too. Would definitely recommend. For the motorcyclists...ride up to Lake of the Clouds...worth the ride and nice, scenic roads in the area. Ask for an old towel from the owner to clean the bike. Access... More"
"This was such a beautiful, clean hotel. A fantastic location with great staff. Our first night was very loud, so they happily moved us to a different room the next morning. The little coffee/snack bar on each floor was such a nice touch - made it easy and convenient to grab a coffee or water. Plus, the decorating was on... More"

Oxford is a great base for both outdoors... More"
"Stayed at the Oxford a couple times now and it has always delivered. Welcoming staff that always greets you with a smile and asks how they can help. This past weekend our suite was amazing and had the perks of a large balcony and steam room shower with two shower heads, which was perfect after a long day of skiing.... More"
"First, let me say that I'm the frugal one in my marriage but my husband booked this hotel because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary. I was skeptical because it was a little pricey. Granted I'm sure for Bend it's average. Boy was I surprised. The Oxford is one of the most amazing hotels we have stayed in. Our room... More"
"Very highly recommended. Outstanding staff. Great location. Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. Tastefully and creatively decorated public areas and rooms. Restaurant very good as well. Stands out as a unique and exceptional vacation experience."
"This place is just a pleasure in every way. Great staff, great rooms and great location. The hotel runs a shuttle to the airport which is really convenient. I love the gym and restaurant. In the heart of Bend and convenient to shopping, etc."
"Nice and clean compared to allot of places out here. Great staff.. Next time we come out here we will stay here.. The bathrooms were very clean and the rooms were not too hot or too cold. Like I said will stay there from now on.."
"For a super affordable price you will get an impeccably clean room, gracious and friendly check-in and assistance, and old-time amenities that include a fire pit, picnic tables and horseshoe pits! There is also a mini dog-park and they are very pet friendly. It is conveniently located only a mile south of Florence on 101, and nearly directly across the... More"
"The room was old, dirty, run down. The rig was filthy. The drapes were torn. I would never stay there again."
"Great"
"Staff was very helpful and courteous."
"Location not too bad. Close to lots of restaurant. There were blood on the sheets, I informed the front desk and they didn't even come to change it."
"Nice affordable close to campus. Big rooms. Clean. Great breakfast. Great value"
"We were staying for one night for the BOA Marching band competition. I reviewed all the pictures online and read the reviews. You will always have mixed reviews. Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home."
"Be prepared for your stay here. We found a Safeway grocers nearby and that made the stay a lot better for our dietary needs. The hotel was well run, but NO ELEVATOR. They even had a waffle maker for breakfast, full choices of on the go breakfast items. The staff were really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. But remember - NO ELEVATOR."
"The room was absolutely horrible. It stunk an was hidious slept on couch because bed look like sheets never been washed. Do not stay here for your own health."
"Worst hotel experience ever. Very seedy place."
"Quiet. Clean. Friendly. Reasonable. What more could i ask for"
"The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there."
"I have worked at Disney for the last 8 years, so I am very hard to please. We did not have a lot of money to spend on this trip. I was very reluctant to stay in a cheap hotel. To my surprise this hotel was clean, comfortable, the breakfast was great. I will stay at this hotel again. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back."
"I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all."
"This hotel is new and extremely clean (trust me...I checked every corner -) ) and the nice girl at the counter (I think her name was Tari or something similar) was very helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this hotel. It is right behind a big shopping center and just 30 minutes from Galveston"
"This was a very nice hotel. Even' with its location near downtown, it was very nice and very clean. I would recommend this hotel highly to anyone traveling to Lexington. The fitness center was great!!"
"We're Hilton Honors members and always have a good experience at any of there Properties. We stay at HomeWood Suites for 2-3 months every year visiting grandchildren and relatives, accumulating enough points to stay free at any of there Hotels between Florida, Illinois Wisconsin. Saves us a lot of Money, we like that :-)"
"I was only staying one night stay, but have been here for work before, and this place is consistent, good every time. Only thing that could have been better was the heating / air conditioning was a bit loud.... I travel with Ear plugs."
"My daughter and I stayed here August 2015. The price was good but you get what you pay for. The desk clerk's young boys were in the lobby when we checked in. She was apologetic because they were rather unruly. Why her husband couldn't take them to the store with him, I don't know. He probably didn't want to be... More"
"We checked into this hotel and I was so surprised how much it has changed. We had stayed here several times when it was a Day's Inn. The room smelled so bad it would make you sick to your stomach. No wash rags so we asked the desk clerk and her response was I will have to call someone to... More"
"Hotel room was filthy dirty. Room had heavy odor of mildew (and my allergies indicated mold was a real problem in the room.) Toilet had issues, even after I reported it to management and they said they fixed it. Door had no deadbolt -- only a push button lock to secure the door. Bedding was dirty. Room had not been... More"
"We loved our stay here. Very accommodating - The owner does not speak real good English, but are very kind and want to please. We asked for a non-smoking room and it was nicer than a smoking one. We got a EXCELLENT RATE! Can't complain about good rates and a comfortable bed and a quiet area. We stayed in room... More"
"Not operational when we went by. Looks very run down and overgrown with vegetation. So if you are looking for an investment property and a challenge this property would fit the bill. Good luck to the current owners and the new owners."
"We will certainly stay here again! It was so nice and clean and comfortable. We felt safe and secure inside our room and outside. All of the employees we came into contact with were so friendly and helpful.And close to lot of things to eat and see right beside the motel...and so peace and no noisy at all...in night .I... More"
"Had to make a last minute reservation to be in Cincinnati, Ohio overnight for an emergency. Needed to be close to the hospital so we booked the Springhill Suites Cincinnati Midtown. I was concerned about it being noisy because of how close it was to the road but the glass in our room was sound proof! Yes, sound proof! No... More"
"Pictures must've been old. I got what I paid for....somewhere to lay my head and shower late at night from long drive. Only good thing is they put us where it was quieter. Stairwell and walkways were not renovated and smelled like urine."
"It is very convenient for my visit. Good hotel for the price."
"Spent three days at the Western Inn. This stay was not planned ahead of time but I am so happy with the result. The rooms are clean and well kept. The staff (family) were very helpful and Davey (father) had a great conversation over a glass of wine he game me. I was pleasantly surprised about Billings in general. The... More"
"Amazing and super courteous staff. Cleanliness is impeccable and the atmosphere was very inviting. Better than good breakfast buffet as well. Would definitely recommend as I will also stay here next time I'm in town."
"I stay here on business and am never disappointed. Friendly and courteous staff, clean rooms, good breakfast to start the day. The shuttle can take you to the Blue Line to take you to downtown Charlotte so you don't have to worry about parking downtown."
"We was there for a wedding and our stay was great. I would recommend this place and we will love to visit again. Breakfast was great, the workers were more than helpful! The reception hall was not far from the hotel"
"I stay in this hotel 3 to 4 times a year. Rooms are always clean and the staff is courteous and quickly resolve anything that might come up. All staff members go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay."
"My wife and I stayed with our dog at this Pet friendly hotel. We had an amazing experience. John Wehringer went above and beyond to accommodate our needs. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly and the price was very affordable. You cannot beat this pet friendly hotel anywhere in the valley. We will definitely be returning to stay.... More"
"My stay at the Red Roof Inn started out with great customer service from John Wehringer. He was very helpful and made sure all my needs were being met. He also took the time to make sure I knew of bad weather coming in that night and the following day to ensure I was prepared for it. The room itself... More"
"I absolutely positively enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I highly recommend it. That guy John W. At the front desk is the greatest love his positive energy and his enthusiastism he made my day. The price is definitely right!!! Rooms are very spacious and well put together...I'll definitely be back"
"I Love red roof! My home had a fire and me and my family had no where to go. John Wehringer, Bianca, Robin ,Charlotte, you guys are angels! The rooms were so clean also thanks you to housekeeping. It's like home away from home.."
"We stayed 1 night as a stopping point for our trip and were very surprised! Great staff, clean room, and good coffee! It's been a while since we used a red roof inn, and I must say I like the updates! We will be back during our next trip!!"
"I travel extensively with my job and I can say, without a doubt, this hotel is absolutely one of the best values I've found. Well-tended, welcoming, with great rooms! It's so nice to find a clean, well-appointed room at a price that fits the average person's budget. The staff were perfect: friendly, down-to-earth and professional. I especially appreciated John Wehringer's... More"
"I don't write many five-star reviews. But this place is great. For starters, I fouled up my reservation and it automatically cancelled. The cheerful, amazing Danita at the front desk fixed me right up and was able to make me a new reservation, which was lucky since hotels in this area are often filled to capacity and one can be... More"
"Once you get settled you feel like you are in the country. You would never know Rio Grande Blvd fronts this property. The room was comfortable and the bed allowed a restful night's sleep. It's only a short walk to the nature and you can walk for miles. It's easy to find and convenient to Old Town. Sue is so... More"
"I go to Tybee Island for fun and relaxation 2 or 3 times a year, and I always stay at the Royal Palm. The staff is always friendly and the rooms, while very basic, are always clean and comfortable. The motel pool is great, and it's only a one-block walk to the beach. I've recommended the Royal Palm to many... More"
"Called Labor Day 2015 (we stayed part of the weekend) to locate a couple lost bathing suits and Scott called me back Tuesday, located the suits, dried them out before sending them to me. He made several calls in that time frame to verify the items and really went the extra mile. Thank you!"
"The hotel was very clean, great employees, room perfect size, and pool and hot tub well kept. The location was perfect for shopping and getting around the city. My teenagers love the breakfast bar. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
"The entire staff at the Days Inn made us feel welcomed and at home during our recent trip to the area for my son's college regional playoffs!"
"We travel for baseball and were given a team rate offer at this hotel lower than other locations. We were told it had been remodeled and they added a new water slide so we decided to give it a try. When we pulled up to the Hotel and Convention Center the first thing we noticed was the overgrown landscape, a... More"
"This was third stay at Marriott and we have been pleased with all phases of service and comfort that Marriott offers to their visitors. They offers a great breakfast and the employees go out of their way to take care of us. If the visitor has their own rental car, they can visit the complete Vegas area as they wish. We came down for the Nascar races and we were happy with each visit. My boys and I recommend Marriott for a great place to stay in Vegas"
"nice clean. conveniently located to strip. shuttles to mandalay bay new york new york every half hour"
"I stay here at least once a year for the last 3. I hate the strip hotels/traffic, this is a great alternative to the strip but within minutes if you are going to the strip or any where else in Vegas and minutes from the airport and only a minute from the freeway. Quiet, clean, comfortable and nice staff."
"Will definitely return as this suite had everything I needed and more!"
"This place is very nice and clean. The location can't be beat, it's within walking distance to everything in town. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We had a really enjoyable stay and will return again."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Holiday Inn Express Suites in the quaint and charming German-American town of Frankenmuth, Michigan. It is a very well located hotel, close to all the main attractions and main street and makes it easy to explore the town. Like most of the Holiday Inns here in Canada that I stay at (Huntsville,...

"A great location for beautiful sunsets, great food close by, and whale watching! We really enjoyed our stay."
"We booked this hotel for our trip in September 2014 and we couldn't be more satisfied. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk was very friendly and welcoming. Our room was nice and very well-kept. It had A/C, high-speed internet, a mini fridge, microwave, safe, iron with ironing board, a well-working TV, plus more! We loved that there was a laundromat... More"
"They had their shuttle pick me up at the airport. My room was clean and quiet. Overall a pleasant stay. Staff was very friendly."
"The Roosevelt staff is very friendly and ready with suggestions for tours and restaurants. The room was spacious and clean. Being centrally located it is an ideal spot for reaching all of downtown Seattle. Additionally it is easy to reach via LINK light rail public transportation from the airport."
"We booked this facility because of the good location, the pictures online the description we got over the phone. It did not deliver! Management is very poor.r The facility is dirty. The meeting room is in a basement (with the 'weight room' a smelly, dirty, unusable kitchen bathroom.) they should be ashamed of the condition of this place what they charge. There are actually many 'long term' guests that reside there from what we could tell as well.r r Not the plac...view moree for a good nights rest in a clean room. Look elswhere.view less"
"There was a mix up with our room and it was not handled well at all. We returned to change clothes before dinner only to find all of our things had been packed up and were sitting behind the front desk!"
"I stayed here for a business meeting being held in a nearby (and much more expensive) hotel. The staff were very nice helpful, the hotel is clean and was recently updated. The complimentary breakfast was excellent and the fitness center well maintained and clean. There is a small bar in the lobby with reasonably-priced drinks but there is no... More"
"Comfortable and clean room and bathroom. Delicious breakfast. Perfect location for our activities along the river with its newly constructed river walk. Renovation of this building in art-deco style is superb -- enjoying the architectural design is part of the experience. Highly recommend this Hampton Inn."
"We arrived before 9am and were able to get our room. Helpful, friendly staff. Great location. Clean. Comfortable beds. Good selection for breakfast. Will definitely stay here if I'm ever in Chicago again!"
"Good location. Excellent staff. Brilliant stay. Accommodation was clean and room spacious enough considering it is located in heart of the city. Magnificent mile on doorstep almost. Although hotel was full with nfl draft visitors the hotel maintains high standard. No hesitation to recommend"
"Nice Hotel Very friendly staff, Nice Breakfast Enjoyed the stay very much. Nice large bathroom"
"I try to be fair and objective in my TripAdvisor reviews, because I take others' reviews seriously when booking a hotel. Unfortunately, the Wyndham Garden Elk Grove Village has been one of the worst examples of bad customer service I have ever encountered. The hotel's bad customer service, and even worse shuttle service left our party out an extra 70,... More"
"If I can I stay here when I come to town. Prices are reasonable, staff is kind and attentive, breakfast is hot and options are nice (especially fresh fruit) and there is ample sitting room. The Hampton has a nice location off the main street (320th) but close to anything you may need (gas, shopping, Starbucks and lots of restaurants).... More"
"Great service and food. No complaints they were very hospitable. When I travel I try to stay at the Hampton inn if there's one near by. Price is afordable and you can't beat the breakfast in the morning. There is a huge variety of food and on Sunday's they serve an even greater variety."
"Great property with friendly and helpful staff. Location is equally convenient to Tacoma and SEATAC. Lots of conveniences and shopping within close proximity. Property is clean well maintained. Prefer this over other lodging in the area."
"The layout of the suite I had was the best room design of all Hamptons I've resided in previously. It was perfect for the entire family--the layout gave us plenty of space. This was a combo business/family trip, so the fact the kids had access to an indoor pool and we were located within easy driving distance to both Seattle... More"
"I am always pleased with my time at a Hampton Inn. I stay for business but would recommend the Hampton Inns for anyone traveling for any reason. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff is extremely caring and friendly. Locations are good and I find that Hampton Inns are consistent with their service and quality wherever they are."
"I need quality rest during the day because I work at night and being tired is not an option in my line of work. The hotel staff make sure there are no issues with noise and the rooms are very clean and comfortable"
"Very nice place to stay when in Asheboro. Staff is super friendly. Rooms are what you would expect for a Fairfield and clean. Free breakfast is actually quite nice with plenty of options. I would certainly recommend this hotel to business travelers."
"While the property is new and has great potential, they also have the rudest staff Management I have ever experienced. I'm a platnium Marriott member and have never before been to a hotel that tried so hard to make me uncomfortable. I shortened a 7 nite stay to 1 nite and found another hotel in the area that was happy to have my business and make me feel comfortable."
"We visit every year for wine tasting. The Richland Courtyard by Marriot is always a excellent experience. The rooms on the ground floor are especially nice with high ceilings. The riverside views are nice, but I prefer the other side as there is some traffic noise from the highway bridge, even though it's quite a distance away."
"I have never stayed at such a nice Days Inn before. The room and bathroom were huge. So clean and new looking. Ladies, the bathroom had the longest granite counter I have ever seen. The sink, shower, and toilet were so clean and sparkly....I was really impressed. Very friendly clerk and spotless breakfast room. I definitely recommend this hotel."
"We have stayed here 5 times in last year. We need pet friendly room. Great view. Service is great, staff nice and friendly. Plenty of grass area to walk our dog. Beds very comfortable."
"Stayed for two night August 2015, easy to find (even for us Brits), swift and efficient service to our rooms ( I was sweating needed AC!) Rooms were, simple and fab. Drinks and greeting at recepton..........cool .........and soo welcoming. Indoor Pool in August!, not really, BUT plenty of lovely spots outside with seats 'chilli's the shade. CURTSY bus into town,... More"
"Loved having a space that we felt could be our own instead of a motel room. Very clean and everything we needed for cooking. Great location and very pleasant folks to deal with. The fact that we were staying in an historical building made it even more charming."
"We stayed here for a night while exploring around Escalante. We were very tired, and the (new) beds were so soft and excellent! We got a great night's sleep here. Nothing fancy but very cozy and warm. (We visited in the winter when morning temps were -10F)"
"We reserved several rooms for our large group. We were impressed with how clean and comfortable our rooms were. We loved the guidebooks in the room and the friendly staff. We used the fire pit to roast hot dogs and marshmallows and appreciated the free firewood. This was a great location-- across the street from a fantastic pizza place and... More"
"This motel was a good surprise. Our room was very clean, and still smelled of bleach. The floor is hardwood, not carpet. I guess it's because of the pets allowed it's also easier to clean. Overall, this motel is an excellent option in Escalante, and don't miss the attached restaurant (Circle D eatery), which is very good."
"Comfortable room in a great town. Nothing fancy, just right for a stop on a road trip. Rob gave us great desk service and local advice. Rooms face the sunrise with was lovely. Guide books in the room were a nice touch and we found some great slot canyons from these. Made our trip even better."
"Love this place. Wanda checked us in after 2 days of camping. She is worth her or my weight in gold !!! Found her in the restaurant at night, she was everywhere and always with a smile and warm welcome. What a find, best place in town. On the westside of town with a Spanish adobe look. The room had...

"Searching for a family reunion site for 50+ folks in Buffalo, WY - we found this place by accident when driving by. Jim, the owner, greeted us and was extremely helpful in determining if this property would work. Besides, cabins for couples families with kids, we need a central place to cook out, eat, sit around watching the fire... More"
"My wife loved the exterior from the moment she saw the house, and she liked our room as well. I think the older style of the house and rooms enhanced our stay in Amish country. The breakfast was tasty, and the hosts catered to my wife's and mother's dietary restrictions. The hosts were friendly, and I felt welcome in their... More"
"On arrival my husband and I needed to walk through the overgrown shrubbery to get to the front door and it had just rained. Needless to say our pants and shoes were wet. Our first impression on entering the premises was that it was very run down. To me there was an odor. It needed new floors and paint. When... More"
"The candlelight inn was great. The room were so pretty and cozy but extremely clean as well. The owner was very friendly and hospitable. The complimentary breakfast in the morning was delicious. I highly recommend staying at this bed and breakfast!!"
"We have stayed at quite a few top-rated bed and breakfasts before, so my expectations are high. We booked this one last-minute on the recommendation of a friend, without even really checking it out. We were attending a show in Lancaster, and the location was perfect. It's quiet, but just down the street from the downtown. I'll be honest, both... More"
"Hal and Karen - CT We've been staying at the CMV for many years. It's a good value. The rooms are not fancy but very clean and comfortable. If you're looking for the Ritz this isn't it but it's a great place in an ideal location. The restaurant is great. Very good selection with excellent flat bread pizza and great... More"
"Worse place ever.rooms were dirty no clean linen smelly everywhere.Owners were not there to get refund.wish we did not check in.Maid did not want to clean the dirty room said not feeling good.THISPlace is a DUMP!!!"
"Went for dinner and food was amazing. Only problem was the owner ray was wasted, knocking drinks over and we stayed all weekend and every night he was drunk. My gf said he wouldn't stop gropping her. Nice place but needs new ownership."
"We can't remember how many times we have stayed at Brewster By The Sea over the years. Each time it is a relaxing and memorable experience. Byron and Donna makes us feel like family each time we visit. They are wonderful hosts and make every effort to ensure we have a perfect visit. The rooms are beautifully decorated and comfortable....

"I was not a guest, but went to spend time with family and friends who were staying there and was quite surprised at the quality and friendliness of the Inn. Even thought I was not a guest I was treated as if I were. The rooms and the common areas are well appointed and the attention to the possible needs... More"
"Very comfortable, quiet and relaxing. We always looked forward to the daily breakfasts. Menu always included juice made fresh with berries (grown by the owners) and melon, and then a main course. Byron, the owner was wonderful. Staff friendly. Looking forward to returning next summer."
"This was a planned getaway for 3 sisters celebrating special birthdays. Everything was above and beyond our expectations! We felt like the Innkeepers had thought of everything! We stayed in the Refugio suite which was more than we could have asked for. Lots of room with a beautiful outdoor sitting area overlooking back gardens. A welcoming box of truffles, ... More"
"I recently stayed at Brewster By the Sea while visiting my parents. This is the sister property to the Captain Freeman Inn in Brewster. Our stay was perfect and I knew it would be as I've stayed at the sister property twice. Our room was lovely. A 4 poster king bed, fireplace and comfy chairs..Impeccably kept property. Breakfast was fantastic... More"
"I pulled into Motel Parking Lot that was empty except for homeless guy with his shopping cart. Motel Sign light blinking as if burning out. Broken bed frame tossed away at side of building. Didn't even get out of car, went to Hotel next door. when calling to cancel, was met with questions as to why, owner not very understanding."
"I love Birch bay getaway I used to go every cpl weeks for awhile. Went back for the first time in over a yr was just like I remembered it. This past weekend we even brought our 1 yr old and he was able to crawl all over without worries of him getting into anything.The cabins are cozy and comfortable... More"
"Staff was excellent and very helpful and accommodating. Stay in Cabin3.....absolutely loved loved loved it. Very clean and stocked with everyday essentials for cooking out and dining. Would recommend highly and I already have my week booked for July. Can't wait. Thanks to the staff that made our stay outstanding."
"Never ever again. The rate for this rooms are to high. Dirty old room,smells like an ex smoking room. Keep the doors closed ,Highway behind the Window and Moskitos. Personal is not friendly. Badest Best Western i ever had."
"Room had a bad smell and shower did not work. Room was not clean. It had a drity bathroom. Spoke to front desk and they did nothing. Call customer service did help by giving a free night stay. Rooms do not look like the pictures."
"Room was not clean and smelled. Hotel culture needs improvement and need better staff training. Management need to be trained in hospitality."
"I wish I could give this hotel zero stars Pro the continental breakfast was decent Cons what the hell does that room 217 reek of PABLO the manager .. Refused to do anything about a room that smelled like crap MARIA the house keeper is a liar saying she smelled it but it was something we did to make it... More"
"The South Street Hotel costs about one-half of the rate at the Hanover Inn. True, you do not look out your window onto the Dartmouth Green, but you can walk to it in two blocks. Our room was spotless and comfortable, the staff is welcoming and helpful. The only quibble I have with it was the air system seemed to... More"
"I have been staying here for 4 years when I visit my son who attends Boise State. Always a great experience, they let me check in early, rooms are comfortable and spacious and the breakfast is great. It is a great location and the hotel staff will drop off at most locations within Boise."
"Small town on the state route - unexpected delight with hotel room. Comfortable, clean and incredibly gorgeous view of the beach, water, sun. Nice to also have the picnic tables, hot tub. Access to town a breeze (because the town is so small). Parking is easy. Easy to find"
"Absolutely terrible..I was told I was being given a Non smoking room. I walked in and it smelled of smoke with a ash tray sitting on table. Checked in late. Smoke is miserable..checking out as I type. Police were in parking lot as I was pulling in. People walking through parking lot heading back to houses in back of hotel..Avoid... More"
"Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help."
